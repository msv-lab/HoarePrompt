Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number as required by the problem description. Instead, it performs a series of conditional checks and manipulations on the integer `x`, returning a modified version of `x` based on its initial value. 

Specifically:
1. If `x` is greater than 0, it increments `x` by 1.
2. If `x` is less than 0, it decrements `x` by 1.
3. If `x` is exactly 0, it remains 0.

None of these operations relate to calculating the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively, where the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers, with base cases defined for n = 0 and n = 1. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.
