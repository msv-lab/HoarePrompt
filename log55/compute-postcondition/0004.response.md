The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` is less than or equal to 0 and specifically less than 0, decrementing `x` will result in a value that is more negative. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is now less than its previous value. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 0, and `x` is less than 0; `x` is now less than its previous value.**
