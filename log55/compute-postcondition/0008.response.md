Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is increased by 1, resulting in a value greater than 1. If `x` is less than 0, then `x` is decreased by 1, resulting in a value that is strictly less than its original value. If `x` is exactly 0, then `x` remains 0 after execution.***
