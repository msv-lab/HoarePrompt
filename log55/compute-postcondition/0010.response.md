The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns the integer value of `x`, which is greater than 1. If `x` is less than 0, the function returns an integer that is strictly less than its original value. If `x` is exactly 0, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a modified value based on the initial value of `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns an integer greater than 1 if x is greater than 0, returns an integer strictly less than x if x is less than 0, or returns 0 if x is exactly 0.**
