The value of `x` is incremented by 1, and since `x` is an integer greater than 0, the new value of `x` will be at least 2. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0, and `x` is now greater than 1.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, and `x` is now greater than 1.**
