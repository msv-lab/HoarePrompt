The function accepts an integer `x` and returns an integer greater than `x` if `x` is greater than 0, strictly less than `x` if `x` is less than 0, or returns 0 if `x` is exactly 0. Specifically, if `x` is positive, it increments `x` by 1. If `x` is negative, it decrements `x` by 1, making it closer to zero but still negative. If `x` is zero, it remains zero after execution.
