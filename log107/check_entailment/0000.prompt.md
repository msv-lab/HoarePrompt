You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix) that calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The matrix may be of any dimension n×n. When the sum is calculated no element of the matrix can be added twice.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

print(func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is equal to the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of `matrix`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n where n is a non-negative integer.
    return total
    #The program returns total, which is equal to the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of the matrix, where matrix is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
