Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem description. The main issue is that it sums both diagonals of the matrix without checking if the central element (in the case of an odd-sized matrix) is being counted twice. 

For example, given the matrix:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```
The main diagonal elements are 1, 5, and 9, and the secondary diagonal elements are 3, 5, and 7. The element 5 is counted twice because it lies on both diagonals. Therefore, the total computed by the function would be:
1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 30, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be:
1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25.

Thus, the function fails to meet the requirement that no element of the matrix can be added twice when calculating the sum of both diagonals.
