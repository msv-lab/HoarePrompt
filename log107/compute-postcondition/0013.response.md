The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n√ón, where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, it calculates the total, which is equal to the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix of integers and return the sum of the elements on both the main and secondary diagonals. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of the matrix.**
