The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. Given that `i` is currently `2`, `total` becomes `total + matrix[2][2]`. The value of `matrix[2][2]` is an integer from the 2D list `matrix`, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `total` now includes this additional value. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón where n must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
