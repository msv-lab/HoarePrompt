The variable `total` is initialized to 0, and since no operations are performed on any of the variables after this initialization, the states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, where `n` is equal to the number of rows in `matrix`; `total` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, where `n` is equal to the number of rows in `matrix`; `total` is 0.**
