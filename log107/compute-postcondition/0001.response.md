The variable `total` is initialized and assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, `total` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, `total` is 0**.
