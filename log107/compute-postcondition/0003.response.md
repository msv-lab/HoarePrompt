The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at the position `matrix[i][i]` to it. Given that `i` is currently `0`, this means we are accessing the first element of the diagonal of the matrix. Since `total` is initially `0`, the new value of `total` will be equal to `matrix[0][0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón where n must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
