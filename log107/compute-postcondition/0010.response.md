The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, `n - i - 1` will be `n - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. Therefore, this code snippet adds `matrix[2][n - 3]` to `total`. The other variables remain unchanged in their states. 

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2] + matrix[2][n - 3]`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón where n must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
