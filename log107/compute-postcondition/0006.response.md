The code updates the value of `total` by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. The initial value of `total` is given as `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`. Since `i` is currently 1, we will add the value of `matrix[1][1]` to `total`. 

Thus, the new value of `total` becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with the value of 1, and the variable `n` remains as an integer greater than 1.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón where n must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
