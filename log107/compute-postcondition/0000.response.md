The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(matrix)`, which calculates the number of rows in the square matrix. Since `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, the length of `matrix` will be equal to `n`, providing the dimension of the matrix. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, where `n` is equal to the number of rows in `matrix`.**
