The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(matrix)`, which calculates the number of rows in the matrix, as the matrix is a square matrix. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.**
