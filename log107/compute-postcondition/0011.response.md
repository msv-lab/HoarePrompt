The loop sums the values of the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of the square matrix. The loop will execute `n` times if `matrix` is a valid square matrix of dimension `n×n`, where `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total` will equal the sum of the elements on both diagonals of the matrix. It is important to note that if `n` is odd, the center element will be counted twice, once for each diagonal.

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal of `matrix`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n where n is a non-negative integer.**
