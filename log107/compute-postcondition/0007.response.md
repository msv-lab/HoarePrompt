To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we need to consider the effects of the statement `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

1. The initial value of `total` is defined as `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.
2. The variable `i` is initially set to 1.
3. The expression `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` translates to `matrix[1][n - 1 - 1] = matrix[1][n - 2]` since `i` is 1.
4. Therefore, the code effectively adds the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]` to `total`.

The other variables (`matrix`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged except for `total`, which is updated based on the value from the matrix.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón where n must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
