According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates `n` times, and for it to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 during each iteration, so at the start of the loop, `i` is 0.

Given that `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimension `n×n`, the existence of this matrix implies that `n` must be at least 1 for the matrix to be defined. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is now 0, and the `matrix` should be defined with dimensions corresponding to `n`.

State: **`total` is 0, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n where n must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
