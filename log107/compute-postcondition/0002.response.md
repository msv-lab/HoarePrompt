According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `total` does not affect the loop execution directly. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`total` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
