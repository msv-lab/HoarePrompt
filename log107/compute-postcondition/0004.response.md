The code updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `total` is initially equal to `matrix[0][0]`, the value being added to `total` is `matrix[0][n - 1]`, which is the last element of the first row of the matrix.

The output state should reflect the updated value of `total` and retain the context of the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón where n must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**
