Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem statement. Instead, it performs conditional operations on an integer input `x`, modifying its value based on certain conditions, and ultimately returns an integer that is less than or equal to 0. 

The requirements of the problem description specifically state that the function must compute the n-th Fibonacci number, which involves a specific mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The current implementation does not contain any logic related to Fibonacci numbers and does not return the n-th Fibonacci number for any integer input. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
