Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer and less than or equal to 0. If `x` is less than -10, it is decreased by 10, resulting in a value less than or equal to -20. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (exclusive), it remains unchanged and is therefore in the range (-10, 0). In all cases, `x` remains less than or equal to 0.***
