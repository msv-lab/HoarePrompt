The value of `x` is decreased by 10. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is less than -10, we can say that `x` is a negative integer. Thus, after the operation, `x` will be even more negative. The exact value of `x` is not specified, but we know it will be decreased by 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 0, `x` is less than 0, `x` is less than -10, and `x` is now decreased by 10.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 0, `x` is less than 0, `x` is less than -10, and `x` is now decreased by 10.**
