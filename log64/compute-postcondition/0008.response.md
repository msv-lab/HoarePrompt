Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, and if `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in a value less than or equal to -20. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (exclusive), it remains unchanged and is therefore in the range (-10, 0). In all cases, after execution, `x` is less than or equal to 0.***
