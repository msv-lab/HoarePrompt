The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `x + 1` if `x` is greater than 0. If `x` is less than or equal to 0 and less than -10, it returns `x - 10`, which results in a value less than or equal to -20. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (exclusive), it returns `x` unchanged. Thus, the output is always less than or equal to 0.
