#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    i = 0
    skipped = 0
    total = 0
    while i < len(numbers):
        if numbers[i] > 0:
            total += numbers[i]
        else:
            skipped += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `numbers`, `skipped` is the count of non-positive integers in the original `numbers` list, and `total` is the sum of all positive integers in the original `numbers` list.
    return skipped, total
    #The program returns the count of non-positive integers in the original list 'numbers' and the sum of all positive integers in the original list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a tuple containing the count of non-positive integers and the sum of all positive integers in the list. It correctly counts all non-positive integers (including zeros and negatives) while summing only the positive integers.
