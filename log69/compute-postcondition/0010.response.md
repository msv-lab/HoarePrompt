The code `total += numbers[i]` adds the value of `numbers[i]` to `total`. The current value of `i` is 1, so we will access the element at index 1 of the `numbers` list. The value of `skipped` does not affect the execution of this line. The `total` variable is updated, but we do not know its previous value. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `total` based on the addition of `numbers[1]`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `skipped` is either 0 or 1; `total` is updated by adding `numbers[1]`.**
