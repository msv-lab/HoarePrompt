The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The states of the other variables, `numbers`, `total`, and `skipped`, are not impacted by this code.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 2; `total` is unchanged; `skipped` is either 1 or 2; `i` is increased by 1.**
