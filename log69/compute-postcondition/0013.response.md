The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`numbers`, `skipped`, and `total`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `skipped` is either 0 or 1, and the length of `numbers` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `skipped` is either 0 or 1, and the length of `numbers` is greater than 1.**
