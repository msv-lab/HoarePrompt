Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `skipped` is either 0 or 1, and the length of `numbers` is greater than 1. If `numbers[1]` is greater than 0, `total` is updated by adding `numbers[1]`. If `numbers[1]` is less than or equal to 0, `skipped` is increased by 1, resulting in `skipped` being either 1 or 2.***
