According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(numbers)`. If `i` is less than the length of `numbers`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `len(numbers)` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(numbers)` must be greater than 2, as `i` needs to be less than `len(numbers)`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `skipped` is either 0 or 1, and len(numbers) is greater than 2**
