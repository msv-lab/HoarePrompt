The value of `skipped` is incremented by 1. Since `skipped` can either be 0 or 1, after the execution, the possible values for `skipped` are 1 or 2. The states of `numbers` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `skipped` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `skipped` is either 1 or 2**
