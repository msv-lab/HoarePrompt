Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `skipped` is either 0 or 1, and `total` is either the value of `numbers[0]` (if `numbers[0]` is greater than 0) or remains 0 (if `numbers[0]` is less than or equal to 0). If `numbers[0]` is positive, `total` is updated to `total + numbers[0]`; otherwise, `skipped` is incremented by 1.***
