The code `total += numbers[i]` assigns the value of `numbers[i]` (the first element of `numbers`, since `i` is 0) to `total`. Given that `numbers[0]` is greater than 0, `total` will be increased by this positive value. The values of `i` and `skipped` remain unchanged, and only `total` is affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `skipped` is 0, and `total` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `numbers[0]`, which is greater than 0.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `skipped` is 0, `total` is updated to total + numbers[0] (where numbers[0] > 0)**
