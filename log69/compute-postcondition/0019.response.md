According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(numbers)`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `numbers`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1 and `len(numbers)` is greater than 2. Since `i` is now equal to or greater than 3 (assuming its initial value was less than or equal to the length of `numbers` before the increment), we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(numbers)`. Therefore, we need to adjust the condition to ensure that `len(numbers)` is greater than `i`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than `i`; `total` is unchanged; `skipped` is either 1 or 2; `i` is increased by 1.**
