The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`numbers`, `skipped`, and `total`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `skipped` is either 0 or 1, and `total` is either the value of `numbers[0]` (if `numbers[0]` is greater than 0) or remains 0 (if `numbers[0]` is less than or equal to 0)**.
