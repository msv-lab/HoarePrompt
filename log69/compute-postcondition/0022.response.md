The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the count of non-positive integers in the original list `numbers` and the sum of all positive integers in the original list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers` and return two values: the count of non-positive integers and the sum of positive integers from that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the count of non-positive integers and the sum of all positive integers in the list.**
