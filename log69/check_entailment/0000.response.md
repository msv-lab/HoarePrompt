Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. Instead, the annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers and calculates the sum of positive integers and the count of non-positive integers in that list. This functionality is completely unrelated to calculating the n-th Fibonacci number.

To illustrate further, the Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The program does not implement any logic that computes Fibonacci numbers, nor does it accept an integer input to determine which Fibonacci number to calculate. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.
