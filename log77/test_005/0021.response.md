According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If `row` has more integers, the loop can execute again for the next integer. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, and `num` is the second integer in `row`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `num` must be updated to the next integer in `row`, and the total will include that next integer.

State: **`total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the third integer in `row`**
