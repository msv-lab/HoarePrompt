The value of `total` is incremented by `num`. Since `total` is initially assigned the value of `num`, this means `total` will now be `num + num`, or `2 * num`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `2 * num`, and `num` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is `2 * num`, `num` remains unchanged**
