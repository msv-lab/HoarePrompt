According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If `row` contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. Since `total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row, it does not directly impact the loop's ability to execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is the last integer in the last processed row, which is irrelevant for the first iteration of the loop since `num` will be assigned the first value from `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one integer, and `num` should be set to the first integer in `row` during the first iteration.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `row`**
