According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. For the loop to execute a second time, `row` must contain at least one more integer than it had at the end of the last iteration. The current state indicates that `total` is the sum of all integers in `row`, and `num` is the last integer in `row`. 

For the loop to execute a second time, the following adjustments must be made:
- `row` must have at least 2 integers (the loop would have already processed one integer during the first iteration).
- `num` would now represent the second integer in the `row` after the first iteration.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the second integer in `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 integers.**
