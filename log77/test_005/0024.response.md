The variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it. Since `num` is the fourth integer in `row`, `total` will increase by that specific value. The initial state indicates that `total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, but the exact numeric value of `num` is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the operation without specifying the final numeric value of `total`.

Output State: **`total` is updated by adding `num` to it, where `num` is the fourth integer in `row`**.
