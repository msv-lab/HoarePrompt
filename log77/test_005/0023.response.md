According to the code, the loop iterates over each integer in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the third integer in `row`, and `total` has been updated to the sum of all integers processed so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer in `row`. 

If there are more integers in `row` after the third integer, then the loop can execute again. Therefore, `num` will be the fourth integer in `row`, and `total` will retain its previous value plus this new `num`.

State: **`total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the fourth integer in `row`, for the loop to execute a fourth time `row` must have at least 4 integers.**
