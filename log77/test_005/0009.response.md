According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `matrix`. If the `matrix` has more rows, the loop will execute again for the next row. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the last processed row, `num` is the last integer in that row, and `row` is the list of integers from the last processed row. For the loop to be executed one more time, the next row must be processed. Thus, `row` must be updated to the next row in the `matrix`, and `total` will then be the sum of integers in that next row. Assuming that the matrix has at least one more row, we can say that `num` will be the last integer in that next row.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row, `num` is the last integer in that row, `row` is the next row in the matrix.**
