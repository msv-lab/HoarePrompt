The value of `total` is updated by adding `num` to it. Since `total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row` and `num` is the third integer in `row`, the new value of `total` becomes `total + num`. The specific values of `total` and `num` are not provided, so we can't calculate the exact new value of `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the third integer in `row`, and `total` is updated to `total + num`.

Output State: **`total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the third integer in `row`, and `total` is updated to `total + num`.**
