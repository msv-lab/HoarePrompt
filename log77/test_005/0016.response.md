According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If the `row` has at least 4 integers, the loop can execute again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row plus `num`, and `num` is the third integer in `row`. Since the loop is iterating over each integer in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time, the `row` must have at least 4 integers, and `num` will then be the fourth integer in the `row`.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row plus `num`, for the loop to execute a fourth time `row` must have at least 4 integers, `num` is the fourth integer in the row.**
