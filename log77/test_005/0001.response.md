According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one integer. Since the state indicates that `total` is 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `row` is indeed the first row of the `matrix`, which must contain at least one integer.

State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time matrix is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, row is the first row in the matrix which contains at least 1 integer**
