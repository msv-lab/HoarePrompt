The value of `total` is incremented by `num`, which is an integer from the first row of the matrix. Since `total` is initially 0, after execution, `total` will equal `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `num` (the value from the first row of the matrix), and `num` is an integer from that row.

Output State: **`total` is `num`, where `num` is an integer from the first row of the matrix**
