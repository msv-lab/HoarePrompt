According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `matrix`. If `matrix` has at least one more row, the loop will execute again for that row. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the sum of all integers in `row` and `num` is the last integer in that `row`. If `row` is empty, `total` remains the initial sum. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `matrix` must contain at least one more row, and `row` will be the next row in `matrix`.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row, `num` is the last integer in that row, for the loop to execute one more time `matrix` must contain at least one more row.**
