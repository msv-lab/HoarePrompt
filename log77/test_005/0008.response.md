To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the characteristics of the loop and the initial state.

The loop iterates over each integer in the specified row of the matrix. Each time it runs, it adds the current integer (referred to as `num`) to the `total`. Given that the initial state indicates that `matrix` has at least one row and that the loop runs over the integers in that row, we can conclude the following:

- If `row` has `m` integers, the loop will execute `m` times.
- After executing the loop `m` times, `total` will equal the sum of all integers in that row.

Since `num` refers to the current integer being processed, after all iterations `num` will be equal to the last integer in the row after the loop completes.

Thus, the output state after the loop completes will be that `total` is the sum of all integers in the specified `row` of the `matrix`, and `num` will be the last integer from that `row`.

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the row, `num` is the last integer in the row, `row` is a list of integers from the matrix.**
