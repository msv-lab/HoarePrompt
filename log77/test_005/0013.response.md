The value of `total` is incremented by `num`. Since `num` is defined as the second integer in `row`, the value of `total` will now be the sum of all integers in the last processed row plus that second integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row plus `num`, `num` is the second integer in `row`, and `row` must have at least 2 integers for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row plus `num`, `num` is the second integer in `row`, and `row` must have at least 2 integers for the loop to execute a second time.**
