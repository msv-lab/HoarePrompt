According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `matrix`. If the matrix contains more rows, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the last integer in `row`, and `row` is the last row processed in the matrix. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another row in the matrix. Thus, we can deduce that the next `row` will be the subsequent row in the matrix, and `total` will need to be updated to include the sum of integers in that new row.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the last integer in `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `matrix` must have at least one more row than it had at the end of the last iteration.**
