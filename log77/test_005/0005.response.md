According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `row`. If `row` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is `2 * num`, and `num` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` will take the next value in `row`, and the index would need to be incremented accordingly.

State: **`total` is `2 * num`, `num` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a third time `row` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the next value in `row`**
