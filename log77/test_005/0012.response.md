According to the code, the loop iterates over the integers in the `row`. For the loop to execute again, there must be more integers in the `row` after the last processed integer. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first integer in `row`, and `total` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `num`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer in the `row`. Therefore, if there are more integers in the `row`, `num` will take the value of the next integer, and for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least one more integer after `num`.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row, `num` is the second integer in `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 integers.**
