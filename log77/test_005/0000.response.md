According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `matrix`. If the matrix has at least 1 row, the loop will execute. Since `total` is initialized to 0 and does not affect the execution of the loop, it can remain as it is. The variable `row` will represent the first row of the matrix during the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the matrix must have at least 1 row, and `row` should be the first row of the matrix.

State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time matrix is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, row is the first row in the matrix**
