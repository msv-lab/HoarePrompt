According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` list. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` has been updated by adding the fourth integer in `row`, which suggests that `num` has taken the value of that fourth integer. For the loop to execute one more time, the iteration must move to the next integer in the `row`. Thus, we need to know the current index in the `row`.

Assuming that the loop has already processed the first four integers, the next integer that `num` will take is the fifth integer in `row`, and the index would be 4.

State: **`total` is updated by adding `num` to it, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 5 integers, `num` is the fifth integer in `row`, and the index is 4**
