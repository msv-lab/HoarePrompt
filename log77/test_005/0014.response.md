According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. If `row` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second integer in `row`, and `row` must have at least 2 integers to allow the loop to execute a second time. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` will be updated to the third integer in `row`, and `row` must have at least 3 integers.

State: **`total` is the sum of all integers in the last processed row plus `num`, `num` is the third integer in `row`, and `row` must have at least 3 integers for the loop to execute a third time.**
