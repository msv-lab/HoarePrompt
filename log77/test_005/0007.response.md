According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `row`. The state indicates that `total` is currently `2 * num + num`, and `num` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must take on the next value from `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the current element in `row`. To execute the loop again, we need to set `num` to the next value in `row`. If `num` is currently at index `i`, the next index would be `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `row`, and `total` should still reflect its current state modified by the new `num`.

State: **`total` is `2 * num + num`, `num` is the next element in `row` (at index i + 1), for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least one more element.**
