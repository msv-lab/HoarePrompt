According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If the `row` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is `num`, which is the current element being processed in the `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `row` must be accessed, which means the loop will go to the next index. 

Assuming the `row` has at least one more element, the `num` will be set to the next element in the `row`. If the current index is `i`, then for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of the `row`.

State: **`total` is `num`, for the loop to execute again `row` must have at least one more element and `num` will be the next element in the `row`.**
