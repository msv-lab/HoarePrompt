The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Since `num` is the second integer in `row`, this means that `total` will now include an additional integer from `row`. The previous value of `total` is the sum of all integers in `row`, and after this operation, `total` will be updated accordingly. The state of `num` and `row` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row,` `num` is the second integer in `row`.

Output State: **`total` is the updated sum of all integers in `row`, `num` is the second integer in `row**
