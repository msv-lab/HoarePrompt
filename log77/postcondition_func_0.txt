The function accepts a list of integers `my_list`. If the length of `my_list` is odd, it returns 0. If the length is even but less than 2, it also returns 0. However, if the length is 2 or greater, the function attempts to return the first element of the list using an incorrect syntax that will raise an error, as it tries to access an index that does not exist in 'my_list' when its length is less than 2. Thus, the function will either return 0 or raise an error depending on the list's length.
