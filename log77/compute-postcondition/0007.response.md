The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `my_list`. `my_list` is a list of integers that can contain both zero and non-zero values. The function has three cases for its output: 

- Case 1: The function returns the integer 0.
- Case 2: The function also returns the integer value 0.
- Case 3: The function returns an error as it tries to access an index that does not exist in `my_list`, since its length is less than 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and return the integer 0 under certain conditions, or raise an error if the list's length is insufficient to perform an operation. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter my_list (a list of integers) and returns 0 in certain conditions, or raises an error if the list's length is less than 2.**
