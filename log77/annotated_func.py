#State of the program right berfore the function call: my_list is a list of integers that can contain both zero and non-zero values.
def func_1(my_list):
    if (len(my_list) % 2 != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers that can contain both zero and non-zero values. The length of `my_list` is even.
    if (len(my_list) >= 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer value 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers that can contain both zero and non-zero values, the length of `my_list` is even, and the length of `my_list` is less than 2.
    return len[0]
    #The program returns an error as it tries to access an index that does not exist in 'my_list', since its length is less than 2 and the list is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `my_list`. If the length of `my_list` is odd, it returns 0. If the length is even but less than 2, it also returns 0. However, if the length is 2 or greater, the function attempts to return the first element of the list using an incorrect syntax that will raise an error, as it tries to access an index that does not exist in 'my_list' when its length is less than 2. Thus, the function will either return 0 or raise an error depending on the list's length.
