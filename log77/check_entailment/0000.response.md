Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires the function to calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in the list and to restart the product calculation when a zero is encountered. However, the provided program does not implement this logic at all.

1. The program checks the length of the list and returns `0` based on certain conditions, but it does not perform any calculations related to the cumulative product of non-zero numbers.
2. The return statement `return len[0]` is incorrect because `len` is a function, not a list, and this will raise an error instead of returning any intended value.
3. The program lacks any loop or mechanism to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, which is necessary to calculate the cumulative product as described.
4. There is no handling of zeros in the list to reset the product calculation as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program does not implement any of the required functionality, and therefore it does not fulfill the problem requirements.
