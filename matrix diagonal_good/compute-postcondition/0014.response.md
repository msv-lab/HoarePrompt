Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n and returns the sum of all diagonal elements from both the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal. If n is 1 (a 1x1 matrix), the function will return the single element as it will be counted in both diagonals. However, if the matrix is not square or contains non-numeric types, the function's behavior is not defined as there are no checks for input validity. **
