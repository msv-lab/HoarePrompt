The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. The variable `i` is equal to 2, which indicates that the value being added is `matrix[2][2]`. The initial value of `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`, `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n where n must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
