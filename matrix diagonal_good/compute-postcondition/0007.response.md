The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is currently 1, the updated value of `total` will include the element from the matrix at the position `[1][n - 1 - 1]`, which simplifies to `matrix[1][n - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`, `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n where n must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
