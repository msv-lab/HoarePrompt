According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is the length of the matrix. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` should start at 0, and the state of `matrix` should be a square matrix of dimensions `n x n`.

State: **`total` is 0, `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n where n must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
