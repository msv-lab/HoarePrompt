Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the issue arises from the way diagonal elements are summed. 

In a square matrix, the main diagonal elements are represented by the indices `matrix[i][i]`, while the secondary diagonal elements are represented by `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. When the matrix has an odd dimension (e.g., 3x3), the center element (which is both on the main and secondary diagonal) will be counted twice. 

For example, consider the following 3x3 matrix:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The main diagonal elements are `1`, `5`, and `9`, and the secondary diagonal elements are `3`, `5`, and `7`. The program would sum these as follows:

- Main diagonal: `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`
- Secondary diagonal: `3 + 5 + 7 = 15`

However, the element `5` is added twice, leading to a total of `15 + 15 = 30`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if the current index `i` is the same for both diagonals (i.e., when `i == n - i - 1`), and if so, only add that element once. This oversight means the program does not comply with the requirement of ensuring that no element is added twice. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the case of odd-dimensional matrices properly.
