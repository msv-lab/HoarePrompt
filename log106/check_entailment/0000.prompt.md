You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix) that calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The matrix may be of any dimension n√ón. When the sum is calculated no element of the matrix can be added twice.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

print(func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to the sum of all diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is a non-negative integer.
    return total
    #The program returns total, which is equal to the sum of all diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the square 2D list 'matrix' with dimensions n x n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a square 2D list of numbers, `matrix`, with dimensions n x n, and returns the sum of all diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. It does not account for cases where the matrix might be empty or not properly formed as a square matrix, which could lead to unintended behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
