The program provided defines a function `func_1` that is intended to calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, as required by the problem description. 

Let's analyze the implementation:

1. The function computes the size of the square matrix `n` using `len(matrix)`.
2. It initializes a variable `total` to zero.
3. It uses a loop to iterate through the indices of the matrix:
   - For each index `i`, it adds the element at the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) to `total`.
   - It also adds the element at the anti-diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to `total`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation regarding the requirement that no element should be counted twice. In a square matrix of odd dimensions (for example, a 3x3 matrix), the center element (which is part of both diagonals) will be added twice. 

For instance, in the 3x3 matrix:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
The center element `5` (at position `(1, 1)`) will be added to `total` once for the main diagonal and once for the anti-diagonal, resulting in `total` incorrectly reflecting the sum of the diagonal elements.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of the problem description because it does not handle the case where the matrix has an odd dimension correctly, leading to double counting of the center element.

Because of this flaw, the program does not fulfill the problem description accurately for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
