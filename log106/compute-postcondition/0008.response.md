According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2], `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
