The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, it returns `total`, which is equal to the sum of all diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the square 2D list `matrix`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square 2D list of numbers and return the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix, which is a square 2D list of numbers, and returns the sum of all diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix.**
