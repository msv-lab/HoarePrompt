The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. Since `i` is equal to 2, `total` becomes `total + matrix[2][2]`. The value of `total` was previously equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`. Therefore, the new value of `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2.**
