The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(matrix)`, which calculates the number of rows (or columns, since `matrix` is square) in the `matrix`. Since `matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `len(matrix)` will return the value `n`, which is the positive integer dimension of the square matrix. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` retains its value as the length of the matrix.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, where `n` is equal to the number of rows (or columns) of `matrix**.
