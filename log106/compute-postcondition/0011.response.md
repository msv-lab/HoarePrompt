To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop and its effects on the variables given the initial state.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the dimension of the square matrix. In each iteration, it adds two specific elements from the `matrix` to `total`. These elements are the current diagonal element `matrix[i][i]` and the anti-diagonal element `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

1. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), the total is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.
2. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), the total becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`.
3. Continuing this way, after `n` iterations, `total` will be the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.

If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `total` will remain 0.

Thus, after completing all iterations of the loop, we have:

- If `n > 0`, `total` will be the sum of the elements on the diagonals of the `n x n` matrix.
- If `n = 0`, `total` will remain 0.

Putting this together, we arrive at the following output state.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to the sum of all diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is a non-negative integer.**
