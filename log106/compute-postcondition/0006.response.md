In this code snippet, `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][i]` to it. The initial state indicates that `total` is already equal to the sum of the first element and the last element of the first row of the matrix. The variable `i` is initially set to 1, and `n` is greater than 1, meaning that the matrix has at least 2 rows and 2 columns.

After executing the code `total += matrix[i][i]`, the value of `total` will change based on the value of `matrix[1][1]`. Specifically, the new value of `total` will be the previous value of `total` plus the value at position `[1][1]` in the matrix.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.**
