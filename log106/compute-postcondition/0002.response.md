According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` values ranging from 0 to `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `total` is 0. For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is initialized at 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
