According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
