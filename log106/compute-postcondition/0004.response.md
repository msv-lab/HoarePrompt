The code adds the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to `total`. Given that `total` was initially equal to `0 + matrix[0][0]`, the current value of `total` will now include the value at the position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Since `i` is `0`, this means we are accessing `matrix[0][n - 1]` (the last element of the first row of the matrix). The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
