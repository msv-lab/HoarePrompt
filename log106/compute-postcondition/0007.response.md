The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the specific value added to `total` is `matrix[1][n - 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of numbers with dimensions n x n, `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1.**
