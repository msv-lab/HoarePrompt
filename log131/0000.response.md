Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `session['ref_count']` is greater than 1. According to the problem description, if `ref_count` is greater than 1, it should be decremented by 1 and `closed` should be set to `False`. However, the program only handles the case where `ref_count` is exactly 1. For example, consider the following sessions dictionary:

```python
sessions = {
    'user1': {'ref_count': 2, 'closed': False}
}
```

When calling `func_1(sessions, 'user1')`, the program will decrement `ref_count` to 1 and set `closed` to `False`, but it should have set `ref_count` to 1 and `closed` to `False`. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the case where `ref_count` is greater than 1.
