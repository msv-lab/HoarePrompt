#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        if (x > 10) :
            return x
            #The program returns the non-negative integer x that is greater than 10
        else :
            return x + 1
            #The program returns a value of x plus 1, where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10, resulting in a value between 2 and 11.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is equal to 0
    x = x + 7
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `x`. If `x` is greater than 10, it returns `x`. If `x` is between 1 and 10 inclusive, it returns `x + 1`. If `x` is 0, it modifies `x` to be `7` but does not return anything, effectively resulting in no output for this case. Therefore, the function does not handle the case when `x` is 0 properly, as it does not return a value.
