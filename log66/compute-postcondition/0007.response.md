The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a non-negative integer. If `x` is greater than 10, the function returns the non-negative integer `x`. If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10, the function returns the value of `x` plus 1, resulting in a value between 2 and 11. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `x` and return `x` if it is greater than 10, or return `x + 1` if it is between 1 and 10 inclusive. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns x if x is greater than 10. If x is between 1 and 10 inclusive, it returns x plus 1.**
