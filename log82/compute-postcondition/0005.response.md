The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero values. 

In Case_1, if all elements of `x` are less than or equal to 0, the function returns a new list where each element of `x` is decreased by 1, resulting in all elements being less than or equal to -1. 

In Case_2, if there is an invalid operation of adding 1 to the entire list, a TypeError occurs, and the function does not return a valid list of integers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `x`, and if all the integers in `x` are less than or equal to 0, it returns a modified list with each element decreased by 1. If there is an invalid operation involving the list, a TypeError occurs without a valid return. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `x` and returns a modified list with each element decreased by 1 if all elements are less than or equal to 0; otherwise, a TypeError occurs.**
