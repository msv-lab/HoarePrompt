Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `x`. If all elements of `x` are less than or equal to 0, it returns a new list with each element decreased by 1. However, if any element of `x` is greater than 0, it attempts to increment the entire list by 1, which results in a TypeError since adding an integer to a list is not valid in Python. Therefore, if `x` contains any positive integers, the function does not return a valid list and raises an error instead. **
