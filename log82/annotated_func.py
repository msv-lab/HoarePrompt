#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero values.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        x += 1
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns a list where each element of `x` (which are all less than or equal to 0) is decreased by 1, resulting in all elements being less than or equal to -1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero values, and we attempt to add 1 to the entire list, which is not valid in Python. Therefore, a TypeError occurs.
    return x
    #The program returns the list of integers 'x', but a TypeError occurs due to the invalid operation of adding 1 to the entire list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `x`. If all elements of `x` are less than or equal to 0, it returns a new list with each element decreased by 1. However, if any element of `x` is greater than 0, it attempts to increment the entire list by 1, which results in a TypeError since adding an integer to a list is not valid in Python. Therefore, if `x` contains any positive integers, the function does not return a valid list and raises an error instead.
