Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the requirements of the problem description at all. The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, but the code provided instead counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`. 

Here are specific examples where the program does not meet the requirements:

1. For input `l = 10`, `r = 50`, `k = 2`, the program should calculate the sum of numbers like `10, 11, 12, ... 50` that contain at most 2 different digits, resulting in a specific sum (in this case `1230`). However, the program does not perform this calculation at all.

2. The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined to count primes instead of summing the specified numbers.

Therefore, since the logic for calculating the sum based on the conditions specified in the problem description is missing, the program is incorrect.
