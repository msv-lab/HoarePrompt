#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer 'n' that is less than or equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. n is larger than 1
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is a non-negative integer, prev is 0, curr is 0, i is n+1
    return curr
    #The program returns the value of variable 'curr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the value of the variable curr using the Fibonacci sequence formula. However, the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in the code is incorrect as it initializes prev and curr incorrectly and updates them in a faulty way leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the functionality should mention that the Fibonacci sequence calculation is erroneous in the provided code.
