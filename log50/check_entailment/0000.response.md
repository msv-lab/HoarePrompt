Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem description. 

The issue lies in the while loop where the Fibonacci sequence is not being generated accurately. The assignment `prev, curr = curr, prev * curr` is incorrect as it should be `prev, curr = curr, prev + curr` to compute the next Fibonacci number correctly.

For example, if we input n=5, the expected Fibonacci number should be 5. However, the current implementation will return 0 due to the incorrect calculation in the loop.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
