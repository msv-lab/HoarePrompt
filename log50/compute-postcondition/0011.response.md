Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, which is 0, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`, which is 0 * 0 = 0. Therefore, after execution, `prev` becomes 0 and `curr` becomes 0. The value of `i` remains 3. 
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, n is larger than 2, prev is 0, curr is 0, i is 3**
