According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is larger than 2 and `i` is 4. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, n is larger than 2, prev is 0, curr is 0, i is 5**
