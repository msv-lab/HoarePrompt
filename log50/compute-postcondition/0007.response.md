According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is larger than 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be larger than 2.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, n is larger than 2, prev is 1, curr is 0, i is 1**
