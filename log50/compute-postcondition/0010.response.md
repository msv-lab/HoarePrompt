According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is larger than 2, `i` is 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need adjustment.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, n is larger than 2, prev is 0, curr is 0, i is 3**
