The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the value of the variable curr using the Fibonacci sequence formula. However, the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in the code is incorrect as it initializes prev and curr incorrectly and updates them in a faulty way leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the functionality should mention that the Fibonacci sequence calculation is erroneous in the provided code.
