Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. Instead, it manipulates the input integer `x` based on its value, returning different results based on whether `x` is positive, negative, or zero. 

The requirements of the problem description are to compute the n-th Fibonacci number, which is a specific sequence defined recursively as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

The program does not perform any calculations related to this sequence, nor does it return the Fibonacci number for any input. The logic implemented in the function is irrelevant to the Fibonacci sequence and does not adhere to the problem description. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
