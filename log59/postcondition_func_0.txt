The function accepts an integer `x` and modifies its value based on the following conditions: if `x` is greater than 0, it returns `x + 1`; if `x` is less than 0, it returns `x - 1`; and if `x` is equal to 0, it returns 0. Thus, the function effectively increments positive integers, decrements negative integers, and returns 0 for zero.
