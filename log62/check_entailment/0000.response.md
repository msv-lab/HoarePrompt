Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` and manipulates its value based on whether it is greater than 0 or 10, but it does not calculate or return the Fibonacci number corresponding to `x`. 

In fact, the function simply returns `x` after potentially modifying it, which is not related to the Fibonacci sequence at all. For instance, if `x` is 5, the function would return 5, but the 5th Fibonacci number is 5, which is coincidental and not an indication of correctness. 

Therefore, the program fails to meet the fundamental requirement of calculating the n-th Fibonacci number as stated in the problem description.
