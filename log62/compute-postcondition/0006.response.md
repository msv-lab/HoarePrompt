The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function returns the value of `x` unchanged if `x` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive), unchanged if `x` is less than or equal to 0, or increased by 10 if `x` is greater than 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return its value based on the specified conditions regarding its range.
