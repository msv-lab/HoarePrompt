The value of `x` is incremented by 10. Since `x` is an integer that is greater than 10, the new value of `x` will be greater than 20. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, and `x` is greater than 20.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, and `x` is greater than 20**
