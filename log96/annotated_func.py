#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a square matrix of integers.**
def func_1(matrix):

    for i in range(n):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
    return total
    #The program returns the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a square matrix of integers as input. It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, considering both the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal, and multiplies this sum by the number of iterations in the loop. The function then returns this total sum.
