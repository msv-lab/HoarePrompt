The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of integers. The function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` and multiplies it by the number of times the loop executed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of integers as input, calculate the sum of the diagonal elements, and return the result multiplied by the number of times the loop executed.
