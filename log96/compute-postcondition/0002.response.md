According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Since `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with a side length of `n`, it implies that the matrix has at least one row and column. Therefore, the loop can execute.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is 0**
