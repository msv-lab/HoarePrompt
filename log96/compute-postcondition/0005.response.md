According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix`, and `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` and `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i+1][n - (i+1) - 1]`**
