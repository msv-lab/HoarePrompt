According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` and `total` has been updated based on certain matrix elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and `total` needs to be updated accordingly.

State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` and `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i+1][n - (i+1) - 1]`, `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i] and `total` is further incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
