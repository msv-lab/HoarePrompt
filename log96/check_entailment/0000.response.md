Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix without adding any element twice.
- The for loop iterates over the rows of the matrix and adds the elements from the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal (calculated using `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total.
- The total is returned as the sum of both diagonals without any element being added twice, as required by the problem description.
- The program meets the requirements stated in the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
