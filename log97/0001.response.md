Correctness: **False**.

The provided program incorrectly handles the case where the matrix size is odd. Specifically, the center element of the matrix, which belongs to both diagonals, is counted twice in the sum. 

For example, consider the following 3x3 matrix:

```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

The two main diagonals are 1, 5, 9 (from top left to bottom right) and 3, 5, 7 (from top right to bottom left). The correct sum should be:

1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25, but since the center element (5) is counted twice in the current implementation, the program will incorrectly compute the total as:

1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 25.

Hence, there is an error where the program does not correctly sum the diagonals without counting any element twice.
