CONDITION_PROMPT = """
You have been assigned the task of a program verifier. You need to determine the conditions under which the loop can execute at least a specified number of times. You must adhere to the text format: Condition: **condition.**


Example1:
Under what conditions can the following loop execute 5 times?
```
while x > 0:
    sum += x
    x -= 1
```
The impact on the variable each time the loop body is executed: `sum` increased by `x`, and `x` decreased by 1.
Now, please think step by step, list the conditions for the first few iterations of the loop, and then try to generalize.


Example Answer:
The number of times the loop can execute depends only on `x`. Each iteration of the loop increases `sum` by `x` and decreases `x` by 1. 

- If `x` is greater than 0, the loop can start.
- If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute at least 2 times.
- If `x` is greater than 2, the loop can execute at least 3 times.

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute at least 5 times is: `x` is greater than 4.  
Condition: **x > 4**


Example2:
Under what conditions can the following loop execute 2 times?
```
for i in range(1, n):
    total_sum += i
```
The impact on the variable each time the loop body is executed: `total_sum` is increased by `i`.
Now, please think step by step, list the conditions for the first few iterations of the loop, and then try to generalize.


Example Answer:
The number of times the loop can execute depends only on `n`. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and iterates up to (but not including) `n`, increasing by 1 each time.

- If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can start.
- If `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute at least 2 times.

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute at least 2 times is: `n` is greater than 2.
Condition: **n > 2**


Your Task:
Under what conditions can the following loop execute {k} times?
```
{program}
```
The impact on the variable each time the loop body is executed: {body_post}
Now, please think step by step, list the conditions for the first few iterations of the loop, and then try to generalize.

VARIABLE_PROMPT = """
You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for extracting the value of the loop variable just before a specific iteration of a `for` loop. The loop variable refers to the local variable defined in the for loop header, which takes on different values in different iterations. Regardless of whether this variable is an underscore ('_') placeholder, you should still provide the value of the loop variable. Please note that any variables and operations within the loop body are not your concern. Focus only on the changes in the variable defined in the loop header. You must adhere to the text format: Variables: **variables.**


Example:
What is the value of the loop variable at the start of iteration 5?
```
for i in range(1, n):
    total_sum += i
```
Now, please think step by step: How does the loop variable change at the start of each iteration? List the results for the first few iterations, and then try to generalize.


Example Answer:
The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and iterates up to (but not including) `n`, increasing by 1 each time.

- At the start of the first iteration, `i = 1`.
- At the start of the second iteration, `i` increases by 1, so `i = 2`.
- At the start of the third iteration, `i` increases by 1, so `i = 3`.

Therefore, at the start of the fifth iteration, the loop variable `i = 5`.
Variables: **i = 5**


Your Task:
What is the value of the loop variable at the start of iteration {k}?
```
{program}
```
Now, please think step by step: How does the loop variable change at the start of each iteration? List the results for the first few iterations, and then try to generalize.

You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for updating the program's state. You will be provided with an old program state and an update patch. Please apply the update to the old state. Please note that according to Python conventions, any variables with an underscore ('_') do not need to be written or updated in the state. You must adhere to the text format: New State: **new state.**

Old State: `x` is 1, `y` is 2

# Example Answer:
# When x is greater than 0, the loop is entered, meaning the loop executes at least once. Each iteration decrements x by 1, so if the loop is expected to execute at least 3 times, x needs to be greater than 3.

# The number of loop iterations depends only on `n`. The loop iterates over the integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `n`), increasing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least 5 times, `n` should be greater than 5. Before the 5th iteration, the variable `i`, controlled by the for loop statement, is 5. `total_sum` is not related to whether the loop can execute one more time, therefore it should retain the state after the previous iteration. Therefore, the condition state is `n` is greater than 5, `total_sum` is 10, `i` is 5.
