The function accepts a non-negative integer `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, it returns `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to 0, it decrements `x` by 1 (resulting in -1) and returns that value. Therefore, the function returns a non-negative integer greater than 1 when `x` is positive, and -1 when `x` is 0. There is no handling for negative values, as the function assumes `x` is always non-negative.
