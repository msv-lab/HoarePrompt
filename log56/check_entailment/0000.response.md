Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not compute the n-th Fibonacci number as required by the problem description. Instead, the function `func_1(x)` performs the following actions:

1. If `x` is greater than 0, it returns `x + 1`, which is not related to the Fibonacci sequence.
2. If `x` is equal to 0, it decrements `x` by 1 and returns `-1`, which is also not a Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and continues with F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n â‰¥ 2. The provided program does not implement this logic at all. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of calculating the n-th Fibonacci number for non-negative integers.
