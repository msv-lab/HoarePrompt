`x` is decremented by 10. Since `x` is an integer that is less than or equal to 0 and specifically less than -10, the new value of `x` will be less than -10. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 0, and `x` is less than -10; after the operation, `x` will be less than -20.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 0, and `x` is less than -20**
