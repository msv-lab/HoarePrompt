The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns the value of `x` increased by 1. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (inclusive), the function returns the value of `x` unchanged. If `x` is less than -10, the function returns the value of `x` decreased by 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a modified value based on the specified conditions of `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns x increased by 1 if x is greater than 0; if x is between -10 and 0 (inclusive), it returns x unchanged; if x is less than -10, it returns x decreased by 10.**
