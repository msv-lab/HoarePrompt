Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. The `pop()` method removes and returns the last item from the list. The `total` and `count` variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less integer, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is assigned the popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less integer, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is assigned the popped integer**
