`odd_sum` is assigned the value of `odd_sum + num`. Given that `odd_sum` is initially 0 and `num` is the first element of `numbers`, `odd_sum` will now equal `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with length between 1 and 5, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is equal to `num`, `num` is the first element in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length between 1 and 5, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is equal to `num`, `num` is the first element in `numbers**
