Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers. If the length of `numbers` is greater than 5, `even_sum` is the sum of all even integers in `numbers`, and `odd_sum` remains 0. If the length of `numbers` is between 1 and 5, `odd_sum` is the sum of all integers in `numbers`, while `even_sum` remains 0. If `numbers` is empty, both `even_sum` and `odd_sum` stay 0, and 'Empty list' is printed.***
