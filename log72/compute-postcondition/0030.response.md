Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `numbers`. If the length of the list is greater than 5, it returns the sum of all even integers in the list and 0 for the odd sum. If the length is between 1 and 5, it returns 0 for the even sum and the sum of all integers in the list for the odd sum. If the list is empty, it prints 'Empty list' and returns (0, 0) for both sums. **
