The code initializes two variables, `even_sum` and `odd_sum`, both assigned the value of 0. The initial state of the variable `numbers` (which is a list of integers) does not affect the initialization of `even_sum` and `odd_sum`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of these two variables without any other changes.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers; `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is 0**
