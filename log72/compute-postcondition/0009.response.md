According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will iterate over each element in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has a length greater than 5, so it has at least 6 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, it must move to the next element in the `numbers` list. If there has been no change to the list and the loop is still able to access more elements, the next `num` should be the next integer in the list.

Since `num` is the current number being processed in the loop, it needs to be adjusted to represent the next number in the list. If the current `num` was the 6th element (index 5), the next value will be the 7th element (index 6).

Thus, the `even_sum` and `odd_sum` remain unchanged unless we know the specific value of `num`, but we can specify that `num` must be the next number in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 6, num is the next integer in the list**
