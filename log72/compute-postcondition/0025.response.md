The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Empty list'. The values of the variables `numbers`, `even_sum`, and `odd_sum` remain unchanged since the print statement does not alter any variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is 0, and the length of `numbers` is 0, with the message 'Empty list' printed.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is 0, the length of `numbers` is 0, and 'Empty list' is printed.**
