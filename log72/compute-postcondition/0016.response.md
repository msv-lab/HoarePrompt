According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the length of `numbers` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `even_sum` is 0 and `odd_sum` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num` should hold the value of the first element in the `numbers` list during the first iteration. 

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length between 1 and 5, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is 0, `num` is the first element in `numbers`**
