`even_sum` is incremented by `num`, and since `num` is an even integer, `even_sum` will increase by that even integer value. The values of `odd_sum` and `numbers` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 5, `even_sum` is the previous value plus `num`, `odd_sum` is 0, `num` is an even integer.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 5, `even_sum` is the previous value plus `num`, `odd_sum` is 0, `num` is an even integer**.
