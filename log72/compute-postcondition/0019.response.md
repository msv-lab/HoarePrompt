`odd_sum` is incremented by `num`, which is equal to the second element in `numbers`. Since `odd_sum` starts at 0, the new value of `odd_sum` will be equal to `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with length between 2 and 5, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is equal to `num`, `num` is the second element in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length between 2 and 5, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is equal to `num`, `num` is the second element in `numbers`**
