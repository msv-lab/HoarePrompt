`odd_sum` is assigned the value of `odd_sum + num`. The value of `odd_sum` is initially 0, and `num` is the third element in the list `numbers`. Therefore, after execution, `odd_sum` will be equal to `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is equal to `num, `num` is the third element in `numbers`**
