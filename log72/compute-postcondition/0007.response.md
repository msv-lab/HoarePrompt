The value of `even_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it. Given that `num` is the second integer in the list `numbers`, and `even_sum` is updated to its previous value plus `num` if `num` is even, the output state will reflect the change based on whether `num` is even or odd. The value of `odd_sum` remains unchanged at 0.

If `num` is even, then `even_sum` will increase. If `num` is odd, `even_sum` remains the same.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `num`. Since we do not have specific values for `even_sum` or `num`, we conclude with a general statement.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 5; `even_sum` is updated to the previous value plus `num` if `num` is even; `odd_sum` remains 0.**
