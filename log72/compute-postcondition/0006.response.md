According to the code, the loop iterates over each integer in the `numbers` list. The loop can execute again as long as there are more integers left in the list to process. 

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 5, and `num` is the first integer in the list. After processing the first integer, for the loop to execute one more time, the next integer in the list must be accessed.

Since the loop has already processed the first integer, to execute one more time, `num` must be set to the second integer in the `numbers` list, and the length of `numbers` should still be greater than 5. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
1. `num` should be the second integer in the list.
2. The length of `numbers` must still be greater than 5.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 5, `even_sum` is updated to the previous value plus `num` if `num` is an even integer; otherwise, `even_sum` remains unchanged, `odd_sum` remains 0, `num` is the second integer in the list.**
