Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem description. Instead, it computes the sum of even and odd integers from a list of integers, which is unrelated to the Fibonacci sequence. 

Specifically, the function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and calculates two sums based on the length of that list. It calculates the sum of even numbers if the length is greater than 5, and the sum of all integers if the length is between 1 and 5. If the list is empty, it simply prints 'Empty list'. None of this behavior aligns with the task of computing the n-th Fibonacci number.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements set by the problem description regarding Fibonacci numbers.
