You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: implement a function computing the n-th Fibonacci's number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    even_sum, odd_sum = 0, 0
    if (len(numbers) > 5) :
        for num in numbers:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even_sum += num
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `even_sum` is the sum of all even integers in `numbers`, `odd_sum` remains 0, and `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 5.
    else :
        if (len(numbers) > 0) :
            for num in numbers:
                odd_sum += num
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of integers with length between 1 and 5, `even_sum` is 0, `odd_sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `numbers`.
        else :
            print('Empty list')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`numbers` is a list of integers with a length between 0 and 5. If `numbers` is not empty, `odd_sum` is the sum of all integers in `numbers` and `even_sum` remains 0. If `numbers` is empty, `odd_sum` stays 0, `even_sum` is 0, and 'Empty list' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`numbers` is a list of integers. If the length of `numbers` is greater than 5, `even_sum` is the sum of all even integers in `numbers`, and `odd_sum` remains 0. If the length of `numbers` is between 1 and 5, `odd_sum` is the sum of all integers in `numbers`, while `even_sum` remains 0. If `numbers` is empty, both `even_sum` and `odd_sum` stay 0, and 'Empty list' is printed.
    return even_sum, odd_sum
    #The program returns the values of even_sum (the sum of all even integers in the list 'numbers' if its length is greater than 5) and odd_sum (the sum of all integers in 'numbers' if its length is between 1 and 5, otherwise 0)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
