Using simple annotated entailment
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should find the average of the positive integers in a list. Instead, the program:

1. Defines and initializes variables `x` and `y`.
2. Prints the sum of `x` and `y`.
3. Finds the maximum of `x` and `y` and prints it.

Since the program does not process a list of numbers to calculate their average, it fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
**************************************************
find the average of the positive integers in a list. 
 #State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters.
def func_1():
    x = 10

y = 20

print('Sum:', x + y)
    try:
        z = max(x, y)
    except (Exception):
        print(e)
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `x` is 10, `y` is 20, `z` is 20. No exception is raised, so the value of `e` is not printed.
    print('Max:', z)

pass
