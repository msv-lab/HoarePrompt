The code `A = A - amount` subtracts the `amount` from the balance of Account A (`A`). Given that the initial state is that `A` is the balance of Account A from the `balances` list and the current value of `A` is greater than or equal to the `amount`, the value of `A` will be updated to `A - amount`. The balance of Account B (`B`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`balances` is a list of two integers where the first element is A - amount and the second element is B; the balance of Account A is now A - amount**
