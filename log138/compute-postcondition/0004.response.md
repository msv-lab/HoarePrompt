The code updates the value of `B` in the `balances` list by adding `amount` to it. Initially, `balances` is a list containing two integers: the first element is `A - amount` (the balance of Account A) and the second element is `B`. After executing the line `B = B + amount`, the value of `B` in the list is updated to `B + amount`.

Output State: **`balances` is a list of two integers where the first element is `A - amount` and the second element is `B + amount`.**
