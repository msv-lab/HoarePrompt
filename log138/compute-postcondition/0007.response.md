The code `B = B + A` updates the value of `B` by adding the value of `A` to it. However, the value of `A` in the initial state is not provided, only that `amount` is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount and is greater than the balance of Account A (which is `0`). Therefore, `A` is equal to `amount`. 

Given the initial state:
- `balances` is `[0, B]`
- `amount` is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount and is greater than the balance of Account A (`0`), so `A` is equal to `amount`.

After executing the code `B = B + A`, the value of `B` is updated to `B + amount`.

Output State: **`balances` is `[0, B + amount]`, `amount` is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount and is greater than the balance of Account A.**
