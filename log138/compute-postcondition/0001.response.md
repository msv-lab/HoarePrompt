In the given code snippet, `B` is assigned the value of `balances['B']`. This means that `B` now holds the balance of Account B from the `balances` list. The balance of Account A (`A`) remains unchanged, and the `amount` variable is also unaffected.

Output State: **`balances` is a list of two integers where the first element is the balance of Account A (A) and the second element is the balance of Account B (B), `amount` is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount, `B` is the balance of Account B from the `balances` list.**
