`balances` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is 'A' and the value is `A`. The code assigns a value to `balances['B']`. Since the initial value of `balances['B']` is not specified, it will be assigned the value of `B`.

Output State: **`balances` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is 'A' and the value is `A`; `balances['B']` is `B`.**
