The program below is incorrect. Given the program, a description of the problem the program is intended to solve, and a description of the actual program's output, generate a counterexample test that demonstrates the discrepancy between the expected and the actual outputs. Explain how this test demonstrates the discrepancy. The provided incorrect program must fail this test. The test must import the tested function from the placeholder <module_name>.


Follow the format in these examples:

# Example 1


Problem description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.

Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output description: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Explanation: According to the output description, the function does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect. Thus, for the 'abba' it will return 2 ('bb' and 'abba'), while the expected output is 6 ('a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'bb' and 'abba').

Counterexample test (note the placeholder <module_name>):
```
from <module_name> import count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends

def test_count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends():
    assert count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends('abba') == 6
```


# Your task

Problem description: You have two “accounts,” each with some integer balance. We want a function that “transfers” an integer amount from Account A to Account B, with the following constraint:

If Account A does not have enough funds for the full amount, then transfer only whatever balance is available to transfer from Account A to Account B.

Program:
```
def func_1(balances, amount):
    A = balances['A']
    B = balances['B']
    if amount <= A:
        A = A - amount
        B = B + amount
    else:
        A = 0
        B = B + A
    balances['A'] = A
    balances['B'] = B
    return balances


```
Output description: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `balances`, which is a dictionary containing the balances of Account A and Account B, and a parameter `amount`, which is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount. The function performs a bank transfer between the two accounts based on the given amount. If the amount is less than or equal to the balance of Account A, the balance of Account A is decreased by the amount, and the balance of Account B is increased by the same amount. If the amount exceeds the balance of Account A, Account A's balance is set to 0, and the entire balance of Account A is transferred to Account B. The function returns a dictionary containing the updated balances of Account A and Account B. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the `amount` is greater than the balance of Account A, the balance of Account A is set to 0, and the remaining balance is added to Account B.
2. If the `amount` is 0, no changes are made to the balances. 
 And the explanation of the output: 

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program handles the case when `amount` is greater than the balance of Account A (`A`). According to the problem description, if Account A does not have enough funds for the full amount, the function should transfer only the available balance from Account A to Account B. However, the current implementation sets `A` to 0 when the amount exceeds the balance of Account A, which means no funds are transferred from Account A to Account B in this case. 

To fix this, the program should decrease `A` by the minimum of `amount` and `A`, and increase `B` by the same amount. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(balances, amount):
    A = balances['A']
    B = balances['B']
    if (amount <= A) :
        A = A - amount
        B = B + amount
    else :
        A = A - A  # This line ensures A is reduced by its own value, effectively setting A to 0 if it's less than amount
        B = B + A  # Since A is now 0, B remains unchanged
    balances['A'] = A
    balances['B'] = B
    return balances
```

In the corrected version, `A` is reduced by the minimum of `amount` and `A`, ensuring that the transfer is limited by the available balance in Account A.
