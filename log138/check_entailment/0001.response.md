Let's generate a counterexample test that demonstrates the discrepancy between the expected and the actual outputs for the given program.

### Problem Description
You have two "accounts," each with some integer balance. We want a function that "transfers" an integer amount from Account A to Account B, with the following constraint:
- If Account A does not have enough funds for the full amount, then transfer only whatever balance is available to transfer from Account A to Account B.

### Program
```python
def func_1(balances, amount):
    A = balances['A']
    B = balances['B']
    if amount <= A:
        A = A - amount
        B = B + amount
    else:
        A = 0
        B = B + A
    balances['A'] = A
    balances['B'] = B
    return balances
```

### Output Description
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `balances`, which is a dictionary containing the balances of Account A and Account B, and a parameter `amount`, which is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount. The function performs a bank transfer between the two accounts based on the given amount. If the amount is less than or equal to the balance of Account A, the balance of Account A is decreased by the amount, and the balance of Account B is increased by the same amount. If the amount exceeds the balance of Account A, Account A's balance is set to 0, and the entire balance of Account A is transferred to Account B. The function returns a dictionary containing the updated balances of Account A and Account B.

### Explanation
The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program handles the case when `amount` is greater than the balance of Account A (`A`). According to the problem description, if Account A does not have enough funds for the full amount, the function should transfer only the available balance from Account A to Account B. However, the current implementation sets `A` to 0 when the amount exceeds the balance of Account A, which means no funds are transferred from Account A to Account B in this case.

### Counterexample Test
Here is a counterexample test that demonstrates the discrepancy:

```python
from <module_name> import func_1

def test_func_1():
    # Initial balances: A = 5, B = 10
    balances = {'A': 5, 'B': 10}
    amount = 7
    
    # Expected output: A = 0, B = 15 (since only 5 can be transferred)
    expected_output = {'A': 0, 'B': 15}
    
    # Actual output
    actual_output = func_1(balances.copy(), amount)
    
    # Asserting the expected output matches the actual output
    assert actual_output == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {actual_output}"
    
    # Additional checks to ensure the function works as expected in other scenarios
    balances = {'A': 10, 'B': 5}
    amount = 15
    expected_output = {'A': 0, 'B': 15}
    actual_output = func_1(balances.copy(), amount)
    assert actual_output == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {actual_output}"
    
    balances = {'A': 3, 'B': 8}
    amount = 2
    expected_output = {'A': 1, 'B': 9}
    actual_output = func_1(balances.copy(), amount)
    assert actual_output == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {actual_output}"
    
    balances = {'A': 10, 'B': 5}
    amount = 5
    expected_output = {'A': 0, 'B': 10}
    actual_output = func_1(balances.copy(), amount)
    assert actual_output == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {actual_output}"
    
    print("All tests passed!")

# Run the test function
test_func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Test
- **Test Case 1:** `amount = 7` and `A = 5`. The expected output is `{'A': 0, 'B': 15}` because only 5 can be transferred from Account A to Account B.
- **Test Case 2:** `amount = 15` and `A = 10`. The expected output is `{'A': 0, 'B': 15}` because only 10 can be transferred from Account A to Account B.
- **Test Case 3:** `amount = 2` and `A = 3`. The expected output is `{'A': 1, 'B': 9}` because 2 can be transferred from Account A to Account B, leaving 1 in Account A.
- **Test Case 4:** `amount = 5` and `A = 10`. The expected output is `{'A': 0, 'B': 10}` because 5 can be transferred from Account A to Account B, leaving 0 in Account A.

These test cases demonstrate that the function does not correctly handle the case where the amount exceeds the balance of Account A, as the current implementation sets `A` to 0, which results in no transfer.
