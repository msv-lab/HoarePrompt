You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have two “accounts,” each with some integer balance. We want a function that “transfers” an integer amount from Account A to Account B, with the following constraint:

If Account A does not have enough funds for the full amount, then transfer only whatever balance is available to transfer from Account A to Account B.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: balances is a list of two integers representing the balances of Account A and Account B, and amount is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount.
def func_1(balances, amount):
    A = balances['A']
    B = balances['B']
    if (amount <= A) :
        A = A - amount
        B = B + amount
    else :
        A = 0
        B = B + A
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`balances` is a list of two integers. If the amount is less than or equal to the balance of Account A (`A`), then the balance of Account A is decreased by the amount and the balance of Account B is increased by the amount. Otherwise, the balance of Account A is set to 0 and the balance of Account B is increased by the amount.
    balances['A'] = A
    balances['B'] = B
    return balances
    #The program returns a dictionary 'balances' that contains at least the key-value pair 'A': A and 'B': B

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
