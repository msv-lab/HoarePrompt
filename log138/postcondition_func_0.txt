The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `balances`, which is a dictionary containing the balances of Account A and Account B, and a parameter `amount`, which is a non-negative integer representing the desired transfer amount. The function performs a bank transfer between the two accounts based on the given amount. If the amount is less than or equal to the balance of Account A, the balance of Account A is decreased by the amount, and the balance of Account B is increased by the same amount. If the amount exceeds the balance of Account A, Account A's balance is set to 0, and the entire balance of Account A is transferred to Account B. The function returns a dictionary containing the updated balances of Account A and Account B. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the `amount` is greater than the balance of Account A, the balance of Account A is set to 0, and the remaining balance is added to Account B.
2. If the `amount` is 0, no changes are made to the balances.
