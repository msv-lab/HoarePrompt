Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number, as required by the problem description. Instead, it defines a function `func_1` that processes a list of tasks, counting how many tasks are 'complete' and how many are 'pending'. 

This program entirely deviates from the requirement of calculating Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The program does not contain any logic related to Fibonacci numbers, nor does it have any parameters or computations that would lead to the determination of the n-th Fibonacci number.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
