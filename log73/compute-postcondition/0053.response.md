According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tasks` list. The loop will execute if there is at least one task in the `tasks` list. Additionally, the variables `task`, `running`, `completed`, and `pending` need to reflect the state of the loop execution. For the loop to be executed, `running` must be true, `completed` and `pending` should be defined based on the count of tasks in the list.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the `tasks` list must contain at least 1 task. At the start of the loop, `task` should refer to the first task in the list.

State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks', `pending` is the total count of 'pending' tasks in `tasks', `task` is the first task in the list**
