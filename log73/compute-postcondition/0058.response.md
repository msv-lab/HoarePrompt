The value of `pending` is incremented by 1. Since `pending` is the total count of 'pending' tasks in `tasks', and the first task in `tasks` is 'pending', it indicates that there is at least one 'pending' task. Therefore, the previous value of `pending` is at least 1. After executing the code, `pending` will increase by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks', `pending` is increased by 1, `task` is the first task in the list, the first task in `tasks` is not 'complete', and the first task is 'pending'.**
