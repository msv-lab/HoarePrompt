The value of `pending` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pending` is not specified. Other variables (`tasks`, `running`, and `task`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true, `task` is the second task in the list, and `pending` is increased by 1.
