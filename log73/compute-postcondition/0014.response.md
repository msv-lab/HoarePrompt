The code prints the string 'Unknown task'. It does not modify any of the variables, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings with at least 2 tasks, `running` is True, `completed` is incremented by 1, `pending` remains 0, and 'Unknown task' is printed.
