The code prints the string 'Unknown task'. This action does not modify any variables or their values. Therefore, the previous state of the variables remains unchanged. The output reflects the unchanged values while indicating the printed message.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in the list, `pending` is the count of 'pending' tasks in the list, and the first task in the list is not 'complete'. The variable `task` is not 'pending'. Printed 'Unknown task'.**
