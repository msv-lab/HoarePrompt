The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Unknown task'. The values of the variables `tasks`, `running`, and `task` remain unchanged after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 3 tasks, `running` is True, `task` is the third task in the list, and 'Unknown task' is printed.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 3 tasks, `running` is True, `task` is the third task in the list, and 'Unknown task' is printed.**
