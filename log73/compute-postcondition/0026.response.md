To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition under which the loop will run, which is `while running:`. 

The variable `running` is assigned the value of `check_status()`, which indicates whether the loop should continue executing. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `running` must evaluate to `True`.

Given the information:
- `tasks` is a list of task statuses ('complete' or 'pending').
- `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in that list.
- `pending` is the count of 'pending' tasks in that list.

Since we do not have specific details about the value of `running`, we can only ensure that it must be `True` for the loop to proceed. 

Thus, no other states need to be adjusted unless we have specific information about the output of `check_status()` that indicates the current status of `running`. 

As such, the relevant state to ensure the loop can execute one more time is simply that `running` should be `True`.

State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing tasks that are either 'complete' or 'pending'; `running` is True; `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in the list; `pending` is the count of 'pending' tasks in the list.**
