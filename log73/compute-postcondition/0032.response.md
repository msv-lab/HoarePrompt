The value of `pending` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pending` is known to be the count of 'pending' tasks in the list, and since we are adding to it, the new value of `pending` will be this count plus 1. The other variables (`tasks`, `running`, `completed`, and `task`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in the list, `pending` is the updated count of 'pending' tasks, and `task` is equal to 'pending'.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in the list, `pending` is the updated count of 'pending' tasks, `task` is equal to 'pending'**
