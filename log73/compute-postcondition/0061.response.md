Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks', and `pending` is the total count of 'pending' tasks in `tasks'. If the first task in `tasks` is 'pending', `pending` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the first task is not 'pending' and not 'complete', 'Unknown task' is printed, leaving `pending` unchanged.***
