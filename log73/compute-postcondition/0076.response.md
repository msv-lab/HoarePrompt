The loop counts the occurrences of 'complete' and 'pending' tasks in the `tasks` list. After executing all iterations of the loop, the values of `completed` and `pending` will reflect the total counts of each respective task type within the `tasks` list. If the list is empty, neither `completed` nor `pending` will change from their initial values of 0.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing tasks, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks`, `pending` is the total count of 'pending' tasks in `tasks`.**
