The value of `pending` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pending` is unknown. The variables `tasks` and `running` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is True, and `pending` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is True, and `pending` is increased by 1.**
