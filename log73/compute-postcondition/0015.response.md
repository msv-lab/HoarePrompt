Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings with at least 2 tasks, `running` is True, and `completed` is incremented by 1. If `task` is 'pending', then `pending` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `pending` remains 0 and 'Unknown task' is printed. This means that if the task is anything other than 'pending', the original state of `pending` will remain unchanged.***
