Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings with at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is 0, and `task` is the first task in the list which is not equal to 'complete'. If `task` is equal to 'pending', then `pending` is increased by 1. If `task` is not equal to 'pending', then `pending` remains 0 and 'Unknown task' is printed.***
