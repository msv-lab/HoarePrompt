Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of strings `tasks` and a boolean `running`. It counts the number of tasks that are 'complete' and 'pending' while the `running` flag is true. The function returns the count of 'complete' tasks and the count of 'pending' tasks. If any task has an unknown status, it prints 'Unknown task'. The `check_status()` function determines whether to continue processing tasks, but since its implementation is unknown, it may affect the loop's execution in ways that are not defined here. The function does not handle cases where `tasks` could be empty or where `running` is false at the start.**
