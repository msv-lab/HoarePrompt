Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks'. If the first task is 'complete', `completed` is increased by 1. If the first task is 'pending', `pending` is increased by 1. If the first task is neither 'complete' nor 'pending', 'Unknown task' is printed, and both `completed` and `pending` remain unchanged.***
