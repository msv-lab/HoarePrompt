The variables `completed` and `pending` are both initialized to 0. The initial state does not provide any information about the tasks list or the boolean variable `running`, so their values and states are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings where each string is either 'complete' or 'pending'; `running` is a boolean indicating whether the tasks should continue to be processed; `completed` is 0, `pending` is 0.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings where each string is either 'complete' or 'pending'; `running` is a boolean indicating whether the tasks should continue to be processed; `completed` is 0, `pending` is 0**.
