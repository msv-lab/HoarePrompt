The code snippet prints the string 'Unknown task'. Since no variables are modified or assigned new values, the previous states of all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any alterations.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings with at least 3 tasks, `running` is True, `completed` is incremented by 1, `pending` remains 0, and `task` is the third task in the list; printed 'Unknown task'**
