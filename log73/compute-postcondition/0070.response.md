The value of `completed` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `completed` is not specified. The values of `tasks`, `running`, and `task` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true, `task` is the second task in the list, and `completed` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true, `task` is the second task in the list, and `completed` is increased by 1.**
