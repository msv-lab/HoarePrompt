To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `completed` and `pending` based on the tasks in the list.

1. The `tasks` list can contain multiple tasks, which can either be 'complete', 'pending', or some other string.
2. For each task in the list:
   - If the task is 'complete', the `completed` count is incremented by 1.
   - If the task is 'pending', the `pending` count is incremented by 1.
   - If the task is neither, the counts remain unchanged, and 'Unknown task' is printed.
3. At the end of the loop, the values of `completed` and `pending` will reflect the counts of 'complete' and 'pending' tasks in the `tasks` list.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing tasks; `running` is True; `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks`; `pending` is the total count of 'pending' tasks in `tasks`.**
