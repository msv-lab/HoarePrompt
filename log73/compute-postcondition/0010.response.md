Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings with at least 1 task, `running` is True, and `completed` is incremented by 1 if the first task is 'complete'. If the first task is 'pending', then `pending` is incremented by 1, while `completed` remains 0. If the first task is neither 'complete' nor 'pending', `completed` remains 0, `pending` remains 0, and 'Unknown task' is printed.***
