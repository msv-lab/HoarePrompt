Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true, and `task` is the second task in the list. If `task` is 'complete', then `completed` is increased by 1. If `task` is 'pending', then `pending` is increased by 1. If `task` is neither 'complete' nor 'pending', the program prints 'Unknown task'.***
