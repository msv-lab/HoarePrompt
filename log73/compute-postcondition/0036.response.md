Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True. If `task` is 'complete', then `completed` is increased by 1 while `pending` remains unchanged. If `task` is 'pending', then `pending` is increased by 1 while `completed` remains unchanged. If `task` is neither 'complete' nor 'pending', then both `completed` and `pending` counts remain unchanged and 'Unknown task' is printed.***
