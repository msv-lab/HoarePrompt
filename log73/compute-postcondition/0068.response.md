Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true. If the current `task` is 'complete', `completed` is increased by 1 and `pending` remains unchanged. If the current `task` is 'pending', `pending` is increased by 1 while `completed` remains unchanged. If the current `task` is neither 'complete' nor 'pending', 'Unknown task' is printed and the values of `pending`, `completed`, and `running` remain unchanged.***
