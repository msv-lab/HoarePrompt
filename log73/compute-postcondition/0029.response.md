The value of `completed` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in the list, which is not specified but will now be one greater. The values of the other variables (`tasks`, `running`, `pending`, and `task`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is one more than the previous count of 'complete' tasks, `pending` is the count of 'pending' tasks, `task` is 'complete'.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is one more than the previous count of 'complete' tasks, `pending` is the count of 'pending' tasks, `task` is 'complete'**
