The variable `completed` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `completed` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`tasks`, `running`, and `task`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 3 tasks, `running` is True, `task` is the third task in the list, and `completed` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 3 tasks, `running` is True, `task` is the third task in the list, and `completed` is increased by 1.**
