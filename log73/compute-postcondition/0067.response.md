Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks` (including the current one), and if the current `task` is 'pending', `pending` is increased by 1. If the `task` is not 'pending', 'Unknown task' is printed, and the values of `pending`, `completed`, and `running` remain unchanged.***
