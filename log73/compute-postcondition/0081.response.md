The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tasks` and `running`. The parameter `tasks` is a list of strings where each string is either 'complete' or 'pending', and the parameter `running` is a boolean indicating whether the tasks should continue to be processed. After executing the function body, the program returns the total count of 'complete' tasks labeled as 'completed' and the total count of 'pending' tasks labeled as 'pending'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of task statuses and a boolean indicating if processing should continue, and it returns the counts of completed and pending tasks. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of strings `tasks` and a boolean `running`, returning the count of 'complete' tasks as 'completed' and the count of 'pending' tasks as 'pending'.**
