According to the code, the loop will execute for each task in the `tasks` list. Since `tasks` is a list containing at least 1 task, and the loop iterates over each task, the key states that need to be adjusted are based on the current task being processed in the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, the first task in the list has been processed. If there is at least one more task in the list, the loop can execute again. To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The `tasks` list will still contain at least 1 task, but we need to ensure that it has more than 1 task to continue the loop.
2. The variable `running` indicates that the loop is still active. 
3. The counts for `completed` and `pending` tasks must be adjusted based on the next task in the list.

Assuming we are currently processing the first task:
- If the first task is 'complete', `completed` would be increased by 1, and we would be checking the next task.
- If the first task is 'pending', the count for `pending` would be increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, we must ensure that:
- The `tasks` list must have at least 2 tasks (since one has already been processed).
- The next task (i.e., the second task) will determine whether `completed` or `pending` should be incremented.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that there are at least 2 tasks in total, and we need to identify what the next task will be.

State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is true, `completed` is the total count of 'complete' tasks in `tasks' (including the current one), `pending` is the total count of 'pending' tasks in `tasks' (including the current one)**
