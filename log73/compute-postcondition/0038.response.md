The value of `completed` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `completed` is unknown since it was not provided in the initial state. The values of `tasks` and `running` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is True, and `completed` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 2 tasks, `running` is True, and `completed` is increased by 1**
