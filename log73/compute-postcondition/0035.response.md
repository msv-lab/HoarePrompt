Postcondition: ***`tasks` is a list of strings containing at least 1 task, `running` is True, `completed` is the count of 'complete' tasks in the list, and `pending` is the count of 'pending' tasks in the list. If the `task` is 'pending', the `pending` count is increased by 1. If the `task` is not 'pending', the `pending` count remains unchanged, and 'Unknown task' is printed.***
