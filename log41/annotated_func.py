#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer n, which is less than or equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns n. This covers all cases where n can be 0 or 1, and the function simply returns n in those scenarios.
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `curr` is 0 or 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n, `i` is decreased by 1
    return curr
    #The program returns the value of curr, which is either 0 or 1
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the value of curr using a loop that seems incorrect since the calculation logic is missing, and it returns this incorrect value of curr. This means the function does not correctly compute the Fibonacci sequence as intended due to the missing functionality in the loop.
