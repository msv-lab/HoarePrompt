Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The logic inside the while loop is incorrect. It is not updating the Fibonacci sequence correctly. Instead of updating `curr` to the sum of `prev` and `curr`, it is updating `curr` to the product of `prev` and `curr`.
2. The loop condition `while i <= n` is also incorrect. It should be `while i < n` to correctly calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.
3. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and then decremented by 1 in each iteration, leading to an infinite loop as it will never reach the value of `n`.

Overall, the program does not correctly compute the n-th Fibonacci number as per the problem description.
