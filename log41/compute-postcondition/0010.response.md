According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `curr` is 0 or 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n` and `i` is decreased by 1**
