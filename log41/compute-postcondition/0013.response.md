According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 1 and it is still less than or equal to `n`. The variables `prev` and `curr` being either 0 or 1 do not affect the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` and `curr` are either 0 or 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n` and `i` is decreased by 1**
