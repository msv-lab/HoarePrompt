Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, which is 1, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`, which is 0. After execution, `prev` becomes 1 and `curr` becomes 0. The value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
