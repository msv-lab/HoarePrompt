The values of `prev` and `curr` are swapped, where `prev` takes the value of `curr` and `curr` takes the value of `prev * curr`. The previous values of `prev` and `curr` are known to be either 0 or 1. After execution, the new values of `prev` and `curr` are determined based on the calculations `prev, curr = curr, prev * curr`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` and `curr` are either 0 or 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n` and `i` is decreased by 1**
