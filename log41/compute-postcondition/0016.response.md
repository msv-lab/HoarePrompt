The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. This covers all cases where `n` can be 0 or 1, and the function simply returns `n` in those scenarios.

Case_2: If `n` is greater than 1, the program returns the value of `curr`, which is either 0 or 1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `n` if it is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the value of `curr`, which is either 0 or 1. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it returns the value of curr, which is either 0 or 1.**
