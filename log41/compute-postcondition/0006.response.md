Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is -1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is -1**
