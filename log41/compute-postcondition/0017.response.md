Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the value of curr using a loop that seems incorrect since the calculation logic is missing, and it returns this incorrect value of curr. This means the function does not correctly compute the Fibonacci sequence as intended due to the missing functionality in the loop.**
