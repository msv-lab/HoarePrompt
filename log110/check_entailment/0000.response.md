Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here are the key issues:

1. **Understanding of the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. However, the `func_2` function's logic does not seem to correctly filter or sum the numbers based on the digit restrictions.

2. **Function Logic**: The logic inside `func_2` is primarily focused on calculating a count based on the number of different digits rather than directly summing the valid numbers. Also, the summation of numbers is not clearly defined within `func_2`. The function seems to be trying to accumulate some counts rather than producing the actual sums of numbers with the required digit properties.

3. **Modulus Operation**: While the modulus operation is used, it seems to be applied to a computed value that does not align with the requirement of summing valid numbers.

4. **No Direct Summation**: The program does not explicitly iterate over the range from `l` to `r` and sum the numbers that meet the digit criteria. Instead, it relies on the `func_2` for some form of calculation without clarity on how it handles the digit constraints.

Overall, the program fails to implement the required logic to check the digits of each number between `l` and `r` and accumulate their sum correctly, as specified in the problem description. Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements.
