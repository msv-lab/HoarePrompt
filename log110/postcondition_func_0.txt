The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)) and an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)). It calculates and returns the result of the expression \((func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) \mod MOD\), where `func_2` is assumed to compute some value based on `r`, `k`, and `dp`, and `MOD` is a constant for modulus operation. The function does not handle cases where `l` equals `r`, and it is unclear if `func_2` can handle edge cases regarding its parameters.
