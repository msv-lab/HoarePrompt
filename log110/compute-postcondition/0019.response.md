Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. If `n` is less than 10^k, then the entry `dp[n, k]` is updated to `n`, and the pair (n, k) is now present in the dictionary `dp`. Otherwise, if `k` is at least 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90`, and then `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.***
