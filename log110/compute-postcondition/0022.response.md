Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, a previously computed result from `dp` for the pair `(n, k)` if it exists, or computes and returns a value based on `n` and `k`. If `n` is less than \(10^k\), it returns `n`; otherwise, it calculates a cumulative sum based on the digits of `n` and the value of `k`, and returns that sum modulo a constant `MOD`. **
