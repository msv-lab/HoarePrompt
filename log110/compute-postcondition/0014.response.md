According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `k` is at least 2, `k - 1` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`, which means `k` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k; `k` must be greater than 4; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * 10 + 90 * (10^{(k - 2)} - 10)`; `i` is 3**
