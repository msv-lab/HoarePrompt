According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `k-1`, meaning that `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given that `k` is greater than 0 (as specified in the state), we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2. Also, since `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins, it can be set to 1 to reflect the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least 2 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k, `k` is at least 2, `dp` now contains the entry `(n, k): 9`, `i` is 1**
