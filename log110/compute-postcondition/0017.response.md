The expression `dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)` updates the value of `dp[n, k]`. 

1. The term `(10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2))` simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 2)`.
2. The term `n // 10 ** (k - 1)` gives the quotient when `n` is divided by `10 ** (k - 1)`, which tells how many times the highest place value (in the base 10 representation of `n`) fits into `n`.
3. Subtracting `1` from `n // 10 ** (k - 1)` means we are decrementing that quotient by 1.

The overall update to `dp[n, k]` is dependent on the values of `n` and `k`, but `dp[n, k]` is increased by a certain amount computed from these variables.

Since `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula, we will include this update in our output state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k; `k` is at least 2; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`**
