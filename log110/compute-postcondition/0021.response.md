The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n < 10^k\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).
- `dp` is a dictionary that stores previously computed results for pairs (n, k).

After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on the following cases:

- Case_1: If certain conditions are met, the program returns 0.
- Case_2: If `n` and `k` exist in the dictionary `dp`, the program returns the previously computed result stored in `dp` for the pair (n, k).
- Case_3: The program returns the value of `dp[n, k]`, which is either `n` if `n < 10^k`, or `dp[n, k] + 90` (mod MOD) if \(k \geq 2\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`, and based on the conditions defined, it returns either 0, a previously computed result from the dictionary, or a calculated value based on `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a non-negative integer), k (a positive integer), and dp (a dictionary), and returns 0, a previously computed result from dp for (n, k), or a calculated value based on n and k.**
