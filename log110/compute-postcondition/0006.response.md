Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary that stores previously computed results for pairs (n, k), `k` is greater than 0, the pair (n, k) is not present in the dictionary `dp`, and the current value of `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`.***
