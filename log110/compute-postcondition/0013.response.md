To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the given variables:

1. The variable `dp[n, k]` is initially assigned the value `9 * 10`.
2. The code snippet updates `dp[n, k]` using the formula:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 9 * 10^{(i - 1)} * (10^{(k - i)} - 10^{(i - 1)})
   \]
   Here, `i` is 2. Therefore, we substitute `i` in the formula:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 9 * 10^{(2 - 1)} * (10^{(k - 2)} - 10^{(2 - 1)}) = 9 * 10^1 * (10^{(k - 2)} - 10^1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 90 * (10^{(k - 2)} - 10)
   \]

3. The values of other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition for `n` (being a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n < 10^k\)) and the value of `k` (at least 2) are still valid after execution.

Thus, we summarize the changes and retain the unchanged variables:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k; `k` is at least 2; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * 10 + 90 * (10^{(k - 2)} - 10)`; `i` is 2.**
