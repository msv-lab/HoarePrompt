def func_1(l, r, k):

    #The program returns the result of the expression (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where func_2 is a function that likely calculates a value based on the parameters r, k, and dp, and MOD is a constant used for the modulus operation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)) and an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)). It calculates and returns the result of the expression \((func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) \mod MOD\), where `func_2` is assumed to compute some value based on `r`, `k`, and `dp`, and `MOD` is a constant for modulus operation. The function does not handle cases where `l` equals `r`, and it is unclear if `func_2` can handle edge cases regarding its parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < 10^k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary that stores previously computed results for pairs (n, k).

The pair (n, k) is not present in the dictionary `dp`.

If `n` is less than 10^k, then the entry `dp[n, k]` is updated to `n`, and the pair (n, k) is now present in the dictionary `dp`. Otherwise, if `k` is at least 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90`, and then `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value of dp[n, k] which is either n if n < 10^k, or dp[n, k] + 90 (mod MOD) if k >= 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, a previously computed result from `dp` for the pair `(n, k)` if it exists, or computes and returns a value based on `n` and `k`. If `n` is less than \(10^k\), it returns `n`; otherwise, it calculates a cumulative sum based on the digits of `n` and the value of `k`, and returns that sum modulo a constant `MOD`.
