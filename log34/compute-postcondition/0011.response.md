The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function calculates the sum of all integers in the list as `total`, and counts the total number of integers in the list as `count`. 

If the length of the `numbers` list is 0, the function returns None. If the length of the `numbers` list is 1, the function returns the only integer in the list. Otherwise, the function calculates the average value of all integers in the list and returns it.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the sum and count of the integers, and return either None, a single integer, or the average value of all integers in the list based on the length of the list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers numbers, calculates the sum and count of the integers. If the length of numbers is 0, it returns None. If the length of numbers is 1, it returns the only integer in the list. Otherwise, it returns the average value of all integers in the list.**
