Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `numbers`. If the length of `numbers` is 0, it returns None. If the length of `numbers` is 1, it returns the only integer in the list. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the average value of all integers in the list. **

This summary covers the main functionality outlined in the annotations. However, it is important to note that the annotations mention the state of the program after the if-else block has been executed, but they do not explicitly cover the case where the input list `numbers` contains multiple elements. It would be beneficial to include a note about handling multi-element lists in the summary to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the function.
