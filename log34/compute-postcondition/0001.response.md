Example Answer: 
`count` is assigned the value 0. The value of `numbers` is a list of integers, and `total` is 0. After execution, the state remains the same, with `numbers` being a list of integers, `total` is 0, and `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
