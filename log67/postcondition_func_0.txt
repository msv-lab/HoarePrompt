The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `x` if `x` is greater than 0. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, it returns `x - 1`. Additionally, if an error occurs during execution, it prints two error messages, but the actual return value remains either `x` or `x - 1`, depending on the condition.
