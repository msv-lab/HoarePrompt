Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number as stated in the problem description. Instead, it performs a simple conditional check on the input integer `x` and returns `x` if it's greater than 0 or `x - 1` if it's less than or equal to 0. There is no logic present to calculate Fibonacci numbers, which are defined as follows:

1. The Fibonacci sequence starts with `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.
2. For `n >= 2`, the Fibonacci number is defined recursively as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`.

The provided function does not adhere to this definition or compute Fibonacci numbers in any way. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
