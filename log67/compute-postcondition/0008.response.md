The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function has three cases for its return value: 

- Case 1: If `x` is greater than 0, the function returns the integer `x`.
- Case 2: If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns `x - 1`.
- Case 3: This case is implicitly covered by the first two, indicating that the function will return `x` if it's greater than 0, or `x - 1` if `x` is less than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return `x` if it is greater than 0, or return `x - 1` if `x` is less than or equal to 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns x if x is greater than 0; if x is less than or equal to 0, it returns x - 1.**
