According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `prev` is the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 as it is the next value after 2 in the range(2, n + 1).
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `prev` is the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr**.
