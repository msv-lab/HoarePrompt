Example Answer:
`prev` and `curr` are assigned new values based on the previous values of `prev` and `curr`. Initially, `prev` is 2 and `curr` is greater than 1. After execution, `prev` will be updated to the previous value of `curr` and `curr` will be updated to the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `prev` is the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `prev` is the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr**`
