The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. In this case, the function returns `n` for all non-negative integers `n`, including edge cases where `n` is either 0 or 1.

If `n` is greater than 1, the function calculates and returns the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either `n` if it is less than or equal to 1, or the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence if `n` is greater than 1.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns n. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.**
