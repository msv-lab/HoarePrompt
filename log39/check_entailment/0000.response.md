Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the nth Fibonacci number. 

In the for loop, the calculation `prev * curr` is not correct for calculating the next Fibonacci number. The correct calculation should be `prev + curr`.

Therefore, for the input of n=2, the program will return 1, which is incorrect. 

A correct implementation of the Fibonacci function would be as follows:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        prev, curr = 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            prev, curr = curr, prev + curr
        return curr

# Now the corrected program will return the correct Fibonacci number for any non-negative integer n
```
