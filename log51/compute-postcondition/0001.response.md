Example Answer:
The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` is greater than 0, adding 1 to it results in a value greater than the initial `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: x is an integer greater than 0 and it has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0 and it has been incremented by 1**
