The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns `x` incremented by 1. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns `x` as it is. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return `x` incremented by 1 if `x` is greater than 0, or return `x` as it is if `x` is less than or equal to 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns x incremented by 1 if x is greater than 0. Otherwise, it returns x as it is.**
