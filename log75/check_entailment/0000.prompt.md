You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in the list. If a 0 is encountered, then add the product so far and start again.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where the integers can be zero or non-zero.
def func_1(numbers):
    total = 1
    total_product = 0
    if (len(numbers) == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`numbers` is a list of integers where the integers can be zero or non-zero; `total` is 1; `total_product` is 0; the length of `numbers` is greater than 0.
    for num in numbers:
        if num != 0:
            total *= num
        else:
            total_product += total
            total = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is the product of all non-zero integers in `numbers`, `total_product` is the sum of products of all groups of consecutive non-zero integers in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers.
    return total_product + total
    #The program returns the sum of total_product (the sum of products of all groups of consecutive non-zero integers in 'numbers') and total (the product of all non-zero integers in 'numbers')

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
