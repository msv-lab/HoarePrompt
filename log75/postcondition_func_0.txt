The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If the list contains non-zero integers, it calculates the product of all non-zero integers. Additionally, it sums the products of groups of consecutive non-zero integers and returns the total of this sum plus the product of all non-zero integers. If there are no non-zero integers, the function will return 0.
