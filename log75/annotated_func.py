#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where the integers can be zero or non-zero.
def func_1(numbers):
    total = 1
    total_product = 0
    if (len(numbers) == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`numbers` is a list of integers where the integers can be zero or non-zero; `total` is 1; `total_product` is 0; the length of `numbers` is greater than 0.
    for num in numbers:
        if num != 0:
            total *= num
        else:
            total_product += total
            total = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is the product of all non-zero integers in `numbers`, `total_product` is the sum of products of all groups of consecutive non-zero integers in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers.
    return total_product + total
    #The program returns the sum of total_product (the sum of products of all groups of consecutive non-zero integers in 'numbers') and total (the product of all non-zero integers in 'numbers')
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If the list contains non-zero integers, it calculates the product of all non-zero integers. Additionally, it sums the products of groups of consecutive non-zero integers and returns the total of this sum plus the product of all non-zero integers. If there are no non-zero integers, the function will return 0.
