Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. If `num` (the first integer in `numbers`) is not equal to 0, then `total` is updated to `total * num`. If `num` is equal to 0, then `total_product` is incremented by `total` (which was 1), and `total` is reset to 1. In either case, `total` will represent the cumulative product of the integers processed so far, while `total_product` will hold the sum of previous products when `num` is 0.***
