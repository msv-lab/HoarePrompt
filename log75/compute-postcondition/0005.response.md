According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the length of `numbers` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. The loop variable `num` will take the value of each integer in the `numbers` list during each iteration. As for the other states, `total` is 1 and `total_product` is 0, but these values do not affect the ability of the loop to start executing. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, it is sufficient that `numbers` has at least 1 element. The initial state of `num` will be the first integer in the `numbers` list during the first iteration.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `total` is 1, `total_product` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `numbers`**
