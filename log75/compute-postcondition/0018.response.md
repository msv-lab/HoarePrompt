The value of `total` is multiplied by `num`, where `num` is the next element in the list `numbers`. Since the specific values of `total` and `num` are not provided, we can say that `total` is affected by being multiplied by `num`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the multiplication operation. 

Output State: **`total` is multiplied by `num`, where `num` is the next element in the list `numbers`**
