The variable `total` is updated by multiplying its previous value (which is 1) by `num`, the first integer in the `numbers` list (which is not equal to 0). As a result, `total` will now hold the value of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is now equal to `num`, `total_product` is 0, and `num` is the first integer in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is now equal to `num`, `total_product` is 0, and `num` is the first integer in `numbers`**.
