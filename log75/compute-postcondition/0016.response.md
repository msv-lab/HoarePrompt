Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one more element. If `num` is not equal to 0, then `total` is updated to the product of the previous `total` and `num`, while `total_product` remains unchanged. If `num` is equal to 0, then `total` is reset to 1, and `total_product` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_product` and the previous `total`.***
