The value of `total` is assigned to 1. The previous value of `total` is stated as "previous total value," but it is overwritten by the new value of 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 more element, `total` is 1, `total_product` is (previous total_product value + previous total), `num` is the next integer in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 more element, `total` is 1, `total_product` is (previous total_product value + previous total), `num` is the next integer in the list.**
