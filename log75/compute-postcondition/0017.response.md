According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one more element than it did in the last iteration, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one more element, and `num` will take the next value from the `numbers` list.

Since `numbers` is a list with at least one more element, for the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still have at least one more element. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list has at least two elements left. 

Now, since `num` takes on the next value in the list, we need to adjust it to reflect the next integer in `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, num is the next element in the list**
