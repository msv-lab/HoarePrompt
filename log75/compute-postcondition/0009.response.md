`total_product` is incremented by the value of `total`, which is 1. Therefore, `total_product` becomes 0 + 1 = 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `total` is 1, `total_product` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `numbers`, and `num` is equal to 0.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `total` is 1, `total_product` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `numbers`, and `num` is equal to 0.**
