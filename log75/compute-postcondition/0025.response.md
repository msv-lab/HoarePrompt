The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of integers, which can include both zero and non-zero values. After executing the function body, if the list `numbers` contains only zeros, the function returns 0. If `numbers` contains non-zero integers, the function calculates the sum of the product of all groups of consecutive non-zero integers (referred to as `total_product`) and the product of all non-zero integers in the list (referred to as `total`), and returns this sum. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and return 0 if all values are zero, or return the sum of specific products if there are non-zero integers present.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns 0 if all integers are zero; otherwise, it returns the sum of the products of all groups of consecutive non-zero integers and the product of all non-zero integers in the list.**
