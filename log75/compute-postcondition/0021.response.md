Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements. If `num` is not equal to 0, `total` is multiplied by `num`. If `num` is equal to 0, `total_product` is increased by `total`, and `total` is reset to 1. This ensures that `total` retains its previous product when `num` is non-zero, while accumulating the product in `total_product` when `num` is zero, preparing for subsequent calculations.***
