You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: implement a function computing the n-th Fibonacci's number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        x += 1
    else :
        if (x < 0) :
            x -= 1
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` is an integer and initially less than or equal to 0. If `x` is less than 0, then after execution, `x` is less than -1. If `x` is equal to 0, `x` remains 0.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is less than 0, then `x` is decremented by 1, resulting in `x` being less than -1. If `x` is equal to 0, then `x` remains 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which has been adjusted according to its initial value: incremented by 1 if greater than 0, decremented by 1 if less than 0, or remains 0 if equal to 0.

```
If the program is not related to the problem description it is incorrect.
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
