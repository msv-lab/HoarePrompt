The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns `x` incremented by 1. If `x` is less than 0, it returns `x` decremented by 1. If `x` is equal to 0, it returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and adjust its value: it returns `x + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, `x - 1` if `x` is less than 0, and 0 if `x` is equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns x incremented by 1 if x is greater than 0, x decremented by 1 if x is less than 0, and 0 if x is equal to 0.**
