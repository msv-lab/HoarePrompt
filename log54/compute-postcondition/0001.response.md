`x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` is an integer and greater than 0, the new value of `x` will be greater than its previous value. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0, and `x` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, and `x` is now incremented by 1**
