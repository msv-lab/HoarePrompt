The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `x` is less than 0, the new value of `x` will be `x - 1`, which remains an integer and will be less than or equal to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0, and now `x` is less than -1.

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, and now `x` is less than -1**
