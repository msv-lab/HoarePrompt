Example Answer:
`x` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `x` is an integer greater than 0, after execution, `x` will be greater than its initial value by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `x` is greater than its initial value.
Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is greater than its initial value**
