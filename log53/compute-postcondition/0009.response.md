Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, it increments `x` by 1. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, it decrements `x` by 1. The function then returns the modified value of `x`. **

The actual functionality of the function is to adjust the value of `x` based on its sign. If `x` is positive, it increases by 1; if `x` is negative or zero, it decreases by 1. The return value is the modified `x`.
