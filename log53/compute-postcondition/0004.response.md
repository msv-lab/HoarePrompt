Example Answer:
The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` is negative, subtracting 1 from a negative number will decrease its absolute value. After execution, `x` will be more negative. Therefore, the Output State is: x is an integer, x is less than or equal to 0, x is negative.
Output State: **x is an integer, x is less than or equal to 0, x is negative**
