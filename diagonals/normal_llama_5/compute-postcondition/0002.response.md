To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which is the length of `matrix`. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` represents both the number of rows and columns.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the specified number. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be the first value in the range, which is 0.

The state of `total` is already given as 0, and the state of `matrix` is given as a square list of lists. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to specify that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
