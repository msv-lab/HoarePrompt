To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. 

From the initial state, we know that `matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is `matrix[0][0]`, and `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` becomes `n - 0 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.

So, the code becomes `total += matrix[0][n - 1]`.

We know that `total` is initially `matrix[0][0]`, so the new value of `total` will be the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not changed by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.**
