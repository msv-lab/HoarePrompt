According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. Also, since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

Additionally, the value of `total` is also dependent on the value of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is incremented to 2, the value of `total` should also be updated to include the elements of the matrix at the new value of `i`. However, the exact value of `total` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of the matrix elements. Therefore, the state of `total` should be updated to reflect its dependency on the new value of `i`.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2] + matrix[2][n - 3] +...`**
