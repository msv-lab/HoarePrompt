To solve this task, let's break down the given code and initial state.


Initial State: `matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`


Now, let's analyze the given code:


`total += matrix[i][i]`


The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][i]` is `matrix[1][1]`. 


The initial value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, so after the execution of the given code, `total` will be `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.


The states of the other variables are not affected.


Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.**
