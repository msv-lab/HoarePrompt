According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 0. In this case, the matrix being a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n guarantees that the loop will execute. Since the loop is starting from 0, the only adjustment needed is to set i to 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer, total is 0, i is 0**
