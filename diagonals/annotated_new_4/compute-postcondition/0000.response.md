Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, where `len()` returns the number of rows in the matrix, which is equal to the number of columns since the matrix is square. Therefore, `n` will be the dimension of the square matrix. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer**
