Example Answer:
The value at position matrix[i][i] is added to `total`, where `i` is 0 initially. Since the matrix is a square 2D list of integers, the value at position matrix[0][0] is added to `total`. Therefore, the value at position matrix[0][0] is added to `total`. After execution, the output state is total is the value at matrix[0][0], i is 0.
Output State: **total is the value at matrix[0][0], i is 0**
