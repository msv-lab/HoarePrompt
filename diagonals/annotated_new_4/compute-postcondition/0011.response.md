According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`total` is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged**
