At the end of the previous iteration, the total is updated after adding the new element from the matrix. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`total` is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix, `i` should be incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged**
