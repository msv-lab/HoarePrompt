Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is currently 1. Therefore, the value of `total` is updated to include the value at `matrix[1][1]`. The state of other variables remains the same.
Output State: **total is the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1**
