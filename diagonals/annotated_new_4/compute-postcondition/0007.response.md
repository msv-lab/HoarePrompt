Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 1. Therefore, `total` becomes the sum of the previous `total` value and the new value from the matrix. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **total is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix**
