Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the new element from the matrix at position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. After execution, the new value of `total` is added to the updated element from the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`total` is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged**
