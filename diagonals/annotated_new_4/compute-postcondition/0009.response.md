Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the new element from the matrix at index `[i][i]`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1, while `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`total` is the updated value after adding the new element from the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged**
