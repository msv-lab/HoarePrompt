The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer. If n is greater than 0, the function will update the variable `total` based on the values in the matrix. If n is 0 or negative, the variable `total` will remain 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, update total based on matrix values if n is greater than 0, and keep total as 0 if n is 0 or negative.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, updates total based on matrix values if n is positive, and keeps total as 0 if n is 0 or negative.**
