Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a flaw in calculating the sum of both diagonals of the square matrix. Specifically, when the matrix has an odd dimension (n), the center element will be counted twice, once in the primary diagonal and once in the secondary diagonal.

For example, consider the following 3x3 matrix:

```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

The primary diagonal elements are 1, 5, and 9, and the secondary diagonal elements are 3, 5, and 7. The current implementation will add the center element (5) twice:

- Primary diagonal sum: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
- Secondary diagonal sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15

Adding both gives 15 + 15 = 30, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25.

Thus, the program does not handle the case where the matrix dimension is odd correctly, which leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
