Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the function `func_1` as follows:

The function `func_1` accepts a square matrix of integers as input. The code calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the sum of the elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) of the matrix.

However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the code does not handle the case where the input matrix is not square. If the input matrix is not square, the function will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` for some `i`.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0). In this case, the function will return 0 without raising any errors.

Considering these potential edge cases, I have formulated the following functionality summary:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal. If the input matrix is not square, the function raises an `IndexError`. If the input matrix is empty, the function returns 0. **
