To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be met for the loop to start and run at least once. The loop depends on the variable `n`, which is the number of rows (or columns) of the `matrix`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `matrix` is a square matrix of integers, and `total` is 0. However, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the first value it will take in the loop.

State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
