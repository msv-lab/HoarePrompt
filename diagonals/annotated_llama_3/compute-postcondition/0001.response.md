`total` is assigned the value `0`. The state of the other variables (`matrix` and `n`) is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) of the `matrix`, `total` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) of the `matrix`, `total` is 0**
