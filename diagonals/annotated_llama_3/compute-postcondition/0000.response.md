The code `n = len(matrix)` assigns the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix) of the `matrix` to the variable `n`. 

Since the initial state is that `matrix` is a square matrix of integers, the value of `n` will be the number of rows (or columns) of this square matrix.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) of the `matrix`**
