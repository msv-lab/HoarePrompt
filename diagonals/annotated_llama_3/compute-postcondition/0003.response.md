To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 0

The given code is:
```
total += matrix[i][i]
```
This code adds the value at the position `[i][i]` in the `matrix` to the `total`.

Since `i` is 0, we are adding the value at the position `[0][0]` in the `matrix` to the `total`. 

The value of `matrix[0][0]` is unknown, but we know it's an integer. Let's call this value `x`. 

So, `total` will become `0 + x = x`.

The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code, and `matrix` remains the same.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `total` is the value at the position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value at the position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0**
