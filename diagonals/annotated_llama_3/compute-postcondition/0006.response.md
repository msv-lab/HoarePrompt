The value of `total` is incremented by the value at position `[i][i]` in the `matrix`. The value of `i` is 1, so the value at position `[1][1]` is added to `total`. The previous value of `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, and `[1][n - 2]` in the `matrix`. The values of `matrix` and `n` are not changed, and `i` is not changed by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]`, and `[1][1]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]`, and `[1][1]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1**
