To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]` counted three times, and `[1][1]` in the `matrix`.
- `i` is 1.

The loop condition is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `i` (which is now 2) is still less than `n`.

The state of `matrix` and the calculation of `total` do not directly affect the loop condition, which depends solely on `i` and `n`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
- `n` needs to be greater than 2 to ensure the loop can execute again.

The state of `total` and the specifics of `matrix` (beyond being a square matrix with at least 1 row/column) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]` counted three times, and `[1][1]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 2**
