The value of `total` is increased by the value at position `[i][i]` in the `matrix`. The value of `i` is 2, so the value at position `[2][2]` in the `matrix` is added to `total`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]` counted three times, `[1][1]`, and `[2][2]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 2**
