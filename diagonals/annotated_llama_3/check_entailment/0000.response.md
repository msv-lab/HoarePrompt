Correctness: **True**

The code correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function `func_1(matrix)` iterates over the rows of the matrix, adding the elements at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) and the elements at the current row and the column index mirrored across the center of the matrix (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum.

The annotations provided accurately describe the state of the program at each point and the overall behavior of the function. The annotations mention that the function raises an `IndexError` if the input matrix is not square, which is a correct observation. The code does not explicitly check if the matrix is square, but attempting to access an element at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` will indeed raise an `IndexError` if the matrix is not square.

The annotations also mention that the function returns 0 if the input matrix is empty. This is also correct, as the `for` loop will not be executed if the matrix is empty, and the function will return the initial value of `total`, which is 0.

The problem description does not provide any examples, but based on the code and the annotations, it appears that the function correctly handles all potential cases, including square matrices of any dimension, non-square matrices (which raise an `IndexError`), and empty matrices (which return 0).

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
