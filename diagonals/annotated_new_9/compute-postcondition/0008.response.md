According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is less than `n+1`, `n` remains the same**
