Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal element of the matrix at index `i`, `i` is added to the `total` variable. The variable `total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**
