Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `matrix`, which is the size of one dimension of the square matrix. Since `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` represents the number of rows or columns in the matrix. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows or columns in the matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows or columns in the matrix**
