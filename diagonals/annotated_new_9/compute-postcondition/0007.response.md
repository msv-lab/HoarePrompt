Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the new diagonal element value which is `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. After execution, the output state is: `total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**
