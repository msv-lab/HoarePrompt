The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. The function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix and stores it in a variable called `total`. The function then returns `total`. If n is 0, the loop for calculating the sum of diagonal elements does not execute, and `total` remains 0. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix `matrix` of size n x n, calculates the sum of diagonal elements, and returns the total sum. If n is 0, the function returns 0.**
