Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the rows of the matrix, adding the element at the current index of the main diagonal and the element at the current index of the counter diagonal to the total sum. This process ensures that no element is added twice, meeting the requirement of the problem description. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality and confirm that it handles the case where `n` is 0 correctly. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and all potential cases, making the correctness **True**.
