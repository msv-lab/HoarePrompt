Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. It calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by iterating over the rows and adding the elements at the corresponding diagonal positions.

However, one potential edge case that comes to mind is when the input matrix is not square. The problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, but the code does not seem to handle it explicitly. 

After examining the output hints, I see that they agree with the code in that the function raises an IndexError if the input matrix is not square. This suggests that the code is indeed correct in this regard.

Another potential edge case is when the input matrix is empty. The problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, but the code returns 0, which seems reasonable.

After carefully examining the code and the output hints, I conclude that the code does follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by iterating over the rows and adding the elements at the corresponding diagonal positions. It also correctly handles the edge cases of non-square matrices and empty matrices, raising an IndexError in the former case and returning 0 in the latter case.
