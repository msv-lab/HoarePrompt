Let's analyze the annotated code and return postconditions.

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square list of lists of integers.

The code calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. The main diagonal consists of elements `matrix[i][i]`, and the anti-diagonal consists of elements `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

The code iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop, and for each row, it adds the corresponding elements on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal to the `total` variable.

The code returns the `total` variable, which represents the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the input matrix is not square (i.e., the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns), the code will raise an IndexError when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.
* If the input matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0.

Based on the code and potential edge cases, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of its main and anti-diagonal elements. If the input matrix is not square, the function raises an IndexError. If the input matrix is empty, the function returns 0. **
