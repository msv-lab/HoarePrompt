The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `matrix[i][i]` is an integer because `matrix` is a list of lists of integers. The value of `i` is 0, so `matrix[i][i]` is the integer at the first row and first column of the `matrix`. The value of `total` was 0, so the new value of `total` is the integer at the first row and first column of the `matrix`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row (or column), `n` is at least 1, `total` is the integer at the first row and first column of the `matrix`, `i` is 0**
