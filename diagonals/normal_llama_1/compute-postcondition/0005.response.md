To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be at least 2, because `i` will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Additionally, since `total` is the sum of the integers at the first row and first column and the first row and last column of the `matrix`, and `i` is the row index, we need to consider the next row. Therefore, the `matrix` must have at least 2 rows (or columns).

The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to 1, because it will be incremented at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 2 rows (or columns), `n` is at least 2, `total` is the sum of the integers at the first row and first column and the first row and last column of the `matrix`, `i` is 1**
