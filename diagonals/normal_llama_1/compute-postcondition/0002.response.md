To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. In this case, the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, and `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. However, this does not guarantee that the loop will execute because `n` could be 0. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1. Additionally, since the loop uses `i` as the loop variable, we need to initialize `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row (or column), `n` is at least 1, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
