Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code is `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. 

The initial state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row (or column), `n` is at least 1, `total` is the integer at the first row and first column of the `matrix`, `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0, `n - i - 1` is `n - 1`. 

So, the code becomes `total += matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The value of `total` is the integer at the first row and first column of the `matrix`, which is `matrix[0][0]`. 

Now, `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row (or column), `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the integers at the first row and first column and the first row and last column of the `matrix`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row (or column), `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the integers at the first row and first column and the first row and last column of the `matrix`, `i` is 0**
