`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `n - i - 1` is `n - 2`. The value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is the integer at the second row and the second last column of the `matrix`. Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 2 rows (or columns), `n` is at least 2, `total` is the sum of the integers at the first row and first column, the first row and last column, the second row and second column, and the second row and the second last column of the `matrix`, `i` is 1.
