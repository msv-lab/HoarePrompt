The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns, and all elements within it are integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the `matrix`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of integers and return the sum of its main and anti-diagonal elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of its main and anti-diagonal elements.**
