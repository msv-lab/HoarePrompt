The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of the values at the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix and stores it in a variable `total`. Additionally, the function uses `i` as the current index of the loop and `n` as the size of the matrix. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate the sum of values at the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix, while handling cases where the size of the matrix is 0 or lower. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of dimensions n x n, calculates the sum of values at the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, and returns the total. If n is 0 or lower, the total remains 0.**
