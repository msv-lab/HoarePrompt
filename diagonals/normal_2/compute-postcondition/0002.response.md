According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the total is 0, so there is no specific requirement related to `total`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, it needs to be set as `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
