Example Answer: 
The function returns the value of `total`. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or lower, so the `total` remains 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `total` is the sum of the values at the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix, `i` is the current index of the loop, `n` is the size of the matrix. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0.
Output State: **`total` is the sum of the values at the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix, `i` is the current index of the loop, `n` is the size of the matrix. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0**
