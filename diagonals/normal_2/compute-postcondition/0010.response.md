Example Answer: 
`total` is updated by adding the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array to itself. The value of `i` is 2, and the value of `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array is added to `total`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
