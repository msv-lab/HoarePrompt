According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. Since `i` is 2, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is updated based on the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2**
