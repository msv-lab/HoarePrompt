According to the code, the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`total` is updated based on the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
