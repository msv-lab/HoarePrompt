Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, where `len(matrix)` returns the number of rows in the square matrix. The value of `n` will be the same as the number of rows/columns in the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix of dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix of dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer**
