Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the matrix `matrix`, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `matrix` is a square matrix, `n` represents the number of rows or columns in the matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: matrix is a square matrix (n x n); `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix.**
Output State: **Precondition: matrix is a square matrix (n x n); `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix.**
