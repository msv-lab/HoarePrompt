Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at index `[i][n - i - 1]` of the matrix. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, so the element added will be `matrix[n][0]`. As `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix + `matrix[n][n]`, after this operation, `total` will include the sum of the diagonal elements and the value at `matrix[n][0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix + `matrix[n][n]`, `i` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix + `matrix[n][n]`, `i` is equal to `n`**
