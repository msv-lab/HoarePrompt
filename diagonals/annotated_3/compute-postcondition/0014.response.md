The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The precondition is that `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update the `total` variable with the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `total` will remain 0. After the loop executes, `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix `matrix` and calculate the sum of the diagonal elements if n is greater than 0. If n is 0 or negative, the sum will be 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix `matrix` (n x n) where n is a positive integer. It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements if n is greater than 0. If n is 0 or negative, the sum will be 0.**
