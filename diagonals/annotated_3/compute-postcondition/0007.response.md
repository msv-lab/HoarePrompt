Example Answer:
The code snippet accesses the element at position `[i][n - i - 1]` in the matrix and adds that value to the `total`. The value of `i` ranges from 0 to `n`, so this operation iterates through the diagonal elements of the matrix and accumulates their values in `total`. After executing this code, the sum of the diagonal elements will be updated.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, `i` is less than `n+1`**
