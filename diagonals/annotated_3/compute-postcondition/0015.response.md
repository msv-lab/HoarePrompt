Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a square matrix `matrix` (n x n) where n is the number of rows/columns in the matrix. It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix by iterating through the rows. If n is greater than 0, the function correctly computes the sum of the diagonal elements. However, if n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the function will incorrectly return 0 instead of handling this edge case. **
