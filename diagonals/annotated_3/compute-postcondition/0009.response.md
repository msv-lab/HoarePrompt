Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the diagonal element at index `i` of the matrix. As `i` is equal to `n`, the diagonal element being accessed is `matrix[n][n]`. After this operation, the sum of the diagonal elements `total` is updated. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix + matrix[n][n], `i` is equal to `n`**
