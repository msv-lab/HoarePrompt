According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1` and `n` needs to be incremented by 1 to indicate the next iteration.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `n` is greater than 0 and incremented by 1, `total` is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix**
