Example Answer:
The `total` variable is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The condition specifies that `n` is greater than `i+1`, so the addition will take place within the bounds of the matrix. The `total` will be updated based on the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated based on the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix, `n` is greater than `i+1`.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix, `n` is greater than `i+1`**
