Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix and stores it in total. The loop will execute as long as n is greater than 0. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and total remains 0. After each iteration, total is updated based on the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. n is always greater than i+1 after the loop executes. The function returns the final value of total.**
