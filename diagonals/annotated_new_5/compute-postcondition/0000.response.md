Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix `n`. Since the matrix is a square matrix, the length of the matrix will give the number of rows or columns in the matrix, which is also the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix**.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix**.
