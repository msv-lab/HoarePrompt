Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by adding the element at index `[i][n - i - 1]` of the matrix in each iteration. As `matrix` is a square matrix, the value of `n` represents the number of rows/columns in the matrix. After the code execution, the total is updated by adding the diagonal element from the right side of the matrix. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix**
