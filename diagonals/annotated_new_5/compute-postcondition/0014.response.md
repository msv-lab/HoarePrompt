The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer. Each element of the matrix is a numerical value. The function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix and stores it in `total`. The loop will continue executing as long as n is greater than 0. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. After each iteration, `total` is updated based on the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. `n` is always greater than `i+1` after the loop executes. The function returns the final value of `total`.
