Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix where each element is a numerical value. It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix and returns the final total. The loop iterates over the diagonal elements of the matrix and accumulates their sum in the variable `total`. The function correctly handles square matrices of any size and computes the sum of diagonal elements accurately.**
