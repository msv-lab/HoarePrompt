Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal of the square matrix `matrix` at index `i` is added to `total`. The value of `total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix**
