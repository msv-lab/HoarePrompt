To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to check if it correctly computes the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix without adding any element twice.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Double Counting**: The program iterates through the matrix and adds both the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left). For matrices of odd dimensions, the middle element (which is `matrix[n//2][n//2]`) will be counted twice, once in each diagonal sum.

### Example Case:
Consider the matrix:
```
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
- The main diagonal elements are `1`, `5`, and `9`, which sum to `15`.
- The secondary diagonal elements are `3`, `5`, and `7`, which sum to `15`.
- The correct sum of both diagonals without double counting is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25`. However, the code will return `30` (15 from the main diagonal + 15 from the secondary diagonal).

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case of odd-sized matrices correctly (specifically, it does not prevent double counting the middle element), it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
