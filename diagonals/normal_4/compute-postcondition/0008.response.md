According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated with the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. Since `i` is 1 and less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated with the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
