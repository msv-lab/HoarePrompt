Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal position `matrix[i][i]` is added to the `total`. Since `i` is initially 0, it will access the element at position `matrix[0][0]`. After the addition, the `total` will be updated with the value at that position. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the value at matrix[0][0], `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the value at matrix[0][0], `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
