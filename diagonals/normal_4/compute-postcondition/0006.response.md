Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is currently 1. The total will now include the value at `matrix[1][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the sum of the values at matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][n-1] and matrix[1][1], `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the sum of the values at matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][n-1] and matrix[1][1], `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
