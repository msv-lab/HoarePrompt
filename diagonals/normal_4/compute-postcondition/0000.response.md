Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the length of the matrix, which indicates the size of the square matrix. The value of `n` is a positive integer based on the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. n is the size of the matrix.**
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. n is the size of the matrix.**
