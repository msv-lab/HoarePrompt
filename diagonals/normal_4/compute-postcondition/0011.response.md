According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated with the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[i][i]`, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]**
