Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. Since `i` is 1, `n` is positive, and `matrix` is a square matrix, the value added to `total` is `matrix[1][n - 2]`. Therefore, the new value of `total` is the previous value of `total` plus `matrix[1][n - 2]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated with the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
