Example Answer:
The function returns `total`, which is the sum of the values at the diagonal and antidiagonal of the square matrix `matrix`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is the sum of the values at the diagonal and antidiagonal of the square matrix `matrix` if `n` is not 0, otherwise `total` is 0.
Output State: **`total` is the sum of the values at the diagonal and antidiagonal of the square matrix `matrix` if `n` is not 0, otherwise `total` is 0**
