The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The precondition is that `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value. After executing the function body, if n is not 0, the function calculates the sum of the values at the diagonal and antidiagonal of the square matrix `matrix` and assigns it to the variable `total`. If n is 0, the function returns 0 as the value of `total`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix `matrix`, calculate the sum of values at the diagonal and antidiagonal if n is not 0, or return 0 if n is 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix matrix, calculates the sum of values at the diagonal and antidiagonal if n is not 0, otherwise returns 0.**
