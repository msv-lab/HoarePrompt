Example Answer: 
The function returns `total`, which contains the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is at least 1, the loop will execute and update the total accordingly. If n is 0, the loop will not execute, and total will remain 0. Therefore, the output state is: total contains the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix if n is at least 1, otherwise, total is 0.
Output State: **total contains the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix if n is at least 1, otherwise, total is 0**
