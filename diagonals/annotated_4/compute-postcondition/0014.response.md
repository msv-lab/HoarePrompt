The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is at least 1, the function returns the total sum; otherwise, it returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix as input and calculate the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix size is at least 1. If the matrix size is 0, the function returns 0.
