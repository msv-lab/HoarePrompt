According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of side length `n`, `total` is the updated value after adding the value at position `(0, n-1)` and `matrix[i][i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[3][3]`**
