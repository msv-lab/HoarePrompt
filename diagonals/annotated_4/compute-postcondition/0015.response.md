Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a square matrix of size n x n where n is a non-negative integer. It calculates the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is at least 1, it returns the total sum; otherwise, it returns 0. The function correctly calculates the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements for matrices with n >= 1. However, there is no specific handling for n = 0, which results in returning 0 without any matrix elements being considered.**
