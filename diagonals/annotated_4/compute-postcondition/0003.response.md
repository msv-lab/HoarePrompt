Example Answer:
The value at position `(i, i)` in the matrix is added to `total`. Since `i` is 0 initially, the value at position `(0, 0)` in the matrix is added to `total`. After execution, the output state is: matrix is a square matrix of side length `n`, `total` is the value at position `(0, 0)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix of side length `n`, `total` is the value at position `(0, 0)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
