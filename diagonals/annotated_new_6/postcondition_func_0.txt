The function `func_1` accepts a square matrix `matrix` where n is a non-negative integer and each element of the matrix is a number. It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) and returns the total sum. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and total remains 0.
