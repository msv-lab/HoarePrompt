Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is the value of the diagonal element at index (0, 0) plus the value of the diagonal element at index (0, n-1) plus the sum of diagonal elements from (0,0) to (0,i), `i` is increased by 1, and `total` is updated to include the diagonal element at index (0, n - i - 1)**
