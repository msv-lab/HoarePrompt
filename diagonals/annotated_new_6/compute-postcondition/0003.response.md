Example Answer:
The code snippet adds the value of the diagonal element at index `(i, i)` to the `total`. The value at `matrix[i][i]` is added to `total`. The `total` is updated accordingly. Since the initial value of `total` is 0 and `i` is 0, the output state after executing the code is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is the value of the diagonal element at index `(0, 0)`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is the value of the diagonal element at index (0, 0), `i` is 0**
