According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated to include the diagonal elements from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1), `i` is increased by 1. 
To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1` and the `total` needs to be updated to include the diagonal element at position `(i, i)` for the new value of `i`.

State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated to include the diagonal elements from (0, 0) to (n, n), `i` is increased by 1**
