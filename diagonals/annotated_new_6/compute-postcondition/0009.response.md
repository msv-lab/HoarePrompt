Example Answer: 
`total` is updated by adding the diagonal element at index (i, i) in the matrix. The value of `i` is increased by 1 after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated to include the diagonal elements from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1), `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated to include the diagonal elements from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1), `i` is increased by 1**
