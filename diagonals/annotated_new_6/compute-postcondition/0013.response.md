Output State: **If n is 0, the loop does not execute, total remains 0. If n is greater than 0, the loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) and stores it in total. `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements, `i` is n and the function returns total**
