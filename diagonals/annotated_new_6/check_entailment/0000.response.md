Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix as described in the problem description. The code iterates over the diagonal elements of the matrix and adds them to the total sum, ensuring that no element is added twice. The annotations also confirm that the program processes the diagonal elements from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) in a square matrix of size n√ón, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the annotations clarify the behavior of the program for the case when n is 0, where the loop does not execute and the total sum remains 0, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Since the code and annotations are in agreement with the problem description and cover all potential cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
