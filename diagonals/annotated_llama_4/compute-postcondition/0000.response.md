The code `n = len(matrix)` assigns the length of the matrix to the variable `n`. Since the matrix is a square matrix, the length of the matrix is equal to the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Output State: **matrix is a square matrix, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix**
