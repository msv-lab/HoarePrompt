According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, which implies that `n` is a positive integer. However, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to specify that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0, since the loop starts from 0.

State: **`matrix` is a square matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
