To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

Given Initial State: `matrix` is a square matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0

Code Snippet:
```python
total += matrix[i][i]
```

Since `matrix` is a square matrix and `i` is 0, `matrix[i][i]` refers to the top-left element of the matrix.

The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[0][0]`. However, the exact value of `matrix[0][0]` is unknown, so we can't provide a specific numerical value for `total`.

The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged, as they are not modified in the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `total` is 0 plus the value of the top-left element of the matrix (`matrix[0][0]`)

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is 0 plus the value of `matrix[0][0]`**
