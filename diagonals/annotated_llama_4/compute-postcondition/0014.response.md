The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square matrix, meaning it is a 2D list of lists where each inner list has the same length as the outer list, with all inner lists having the same length, and all elements of the matrix are numbers.

After executing the function body, if the size of the matrix (`n`) is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If the size of the matrix (`n`) is 0, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of numbers and return the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix is non-empty, or 0 if the matrix is empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of numbers and returns the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix is non-empty, or 0 if the matrix is empty.**
