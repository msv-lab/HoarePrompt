Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, but the code does not check if the input matrix is indeed square. If the input matrix is not square, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.

The annotations mention that "if the input matrix is not square or contains non-numeric elements, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception." This suggests that the code does not handle these edge cases correctly. However, the problem description does not provide any information about how to handle non-square matrices or matrices with non-numeric elements.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input matrix is not square. For example, if the input matrix is a 3x4 matrix, the function will attempt to access elements outside the bounds of the matrix, leading to an IndexError.

To fix this issue, the code should add a check to ensure that the input matrix is square before attempting to calculate the sum of the diagonals. This can be done by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:
```python
if len(matrix)!= len(matrix[0]):
    raise ValueError("Input matrix is not square")
```
With this check in place, the function will correctly handle non-square matrices and raise a ValueError if the input matrix is not square.
