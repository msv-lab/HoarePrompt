Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of a square matrix, but it does not ensure that no element of the matrix is added twice. This violates the requirement in the problem description that states "no element of the matrix can be added twice".

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet all the requirements of the problem description. The annotations did not influence the reasoning in this case as the actual code implementation clearly violates the stated problem description.
