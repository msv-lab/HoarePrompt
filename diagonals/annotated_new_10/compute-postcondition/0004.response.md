Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of the diagonal element at position (i, n - i - 1) in the matrix. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the code snippet calculates the sum of the anti-diagonal elements of the matrix and adds it to the total. The updated value of `total` will be the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements. The matrix itself is not changed by this operation.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n**
