Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a square matrix with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. It computes the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix and returns this total sum. If the matrix is empty (n = 0), the function returns 0. The function correctly calculates the sum of diagonal and anti-diagonal elements based on the actual code implementation.**
