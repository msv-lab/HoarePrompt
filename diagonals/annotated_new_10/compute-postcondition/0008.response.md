According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix with the additional element at the last row and last column, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n-1, and `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `n-2` to satisfy the condition `i` is less than `n`.
State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix with the additional element at the last row and last column, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n-2, `total` is incremented by the value of matrix[i][n - i - 1]**
