Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is equal to `n - 2`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix with the additional element at the last row and last column, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n-2, `total` is incremented by the value of matrix[i][n - i - 1], and `total` is further incremented by the value of matrix[i][i].
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix with the additional element at the last row and last column, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n-2, `total` is incremented by the value of matrix[i][n - i - 1], and `total` is further incremented by the value of matrix[i][i]**
