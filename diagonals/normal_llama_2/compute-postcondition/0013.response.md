Based on the initial state and the provided code snippet, here is the output state:

The function returns `total`. If `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix, and `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `total` is 0. The return statement does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix, `i` is `n-1`, and the function returns `total`. If `n` is 0, `total` is 0, and the function returns 0.**
