To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute again. However, to guarantee the loop will execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, because if `n` is exactly 2, the loop will terminate after the current iteration.

The state of `matrix` and `total` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]`, `i` is 1**
