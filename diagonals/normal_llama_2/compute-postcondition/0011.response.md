According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2, because if `n` is 2, the loop will terminate.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total` is increased by twice the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` plus `matrix[1][1]`, and `i` is 2**
