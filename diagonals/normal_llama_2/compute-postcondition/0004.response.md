To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `total` is the value of the first element of the first sublist in `matrix`.
- `i` is 0.

The code to execute is:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Given that `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, the code effectively becomes:
```python
total += matrix[0][n - 1]
```

Since `total` initially holds the value of the first element of the first sublist in `matrix` (which is `matrix[0][0]`), and we are adding the value of `matrix[0][n - 1]` to it, the new value of `total` will be the sum of these two elements.

The states of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. Only the value of `total` is updated.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist and the nth element of the first sublist in `matrix`.
- `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist and the nth element of the first sublist in `matrix`, `i` is 0**
