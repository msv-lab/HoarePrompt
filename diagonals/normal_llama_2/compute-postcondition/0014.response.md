The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square list of lists (2D list) of integers, where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. 

After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix if the number of rows (or columns) `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square 2D list of integers and return the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix is not empty; otherwise, it returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix is not empty; otherwise, it returns 0.**
