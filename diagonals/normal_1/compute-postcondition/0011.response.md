According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) and `total` is the updated value after specific additions. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be increased by 1 and `total` should be updated based on the new `i` value.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n], matrix[1][n-1], and matrix[2][n-2] + matrix[2][3]**
