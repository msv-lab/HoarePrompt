Example Answer: 
The variable `total` is assigned the value 0. Since no operations are performed on the matrix, the state of the matrix remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer; `n` is the length of the matrix, `total` is 0.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer; `n` is the length of the matrix, `total` is 0**
