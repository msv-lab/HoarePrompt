Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the value added to `total` is `matrix[0][n - 1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
