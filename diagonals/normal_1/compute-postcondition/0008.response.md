According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1] and matrix[1][n - 2], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 2.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1] and matrix[1][n - 2], `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
