According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
