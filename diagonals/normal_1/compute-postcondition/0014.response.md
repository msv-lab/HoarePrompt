The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements in the zigzag pattern of the square matrix and returns this total sum. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix `matrix` and return the sum of the diagonal elements in the zigzag pattern of the matrix.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of size n x n, calculates the sum of the diagonal elements in the zigzag pattern, and returns the total sum.**
