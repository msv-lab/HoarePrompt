Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. As `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `matrix` is a square matrix, the new value of `total` will be the previous value of `total` plus `matrix[1][n - 2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1] and matrix[1][n - 2], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `total` is the updated value after adding matrix[0][n - 1] and matrix[1][n - 2], `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
