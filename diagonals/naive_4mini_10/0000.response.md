To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code.

### Problem Description:
The program should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix (n√ón), ensuring that no element is counted twice.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program correctly initializes `total` to zero and iterates through the range of the matrix size `n`.
2. It adds the elements of the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) using `matrix[i][i]`.
3. It adds the elements of the secondary diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left) using `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.
4. However, for matrices of odd dimensions (e.g., 3x3), the center element (which is `matrix[n//2][n//2]`) is counted twice (once in each diagonal).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input for the function:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
Calculating the expected sum:
- Main diagonal: `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`
- Secondary diagonal: `3 + 5 + 7 = 15`
- Total sum without double counting: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 - 5 = 30`

The function would calculate:
- `total = 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 30` (incorrectly counts `5` twice).

### Conclusion:
The program does not accurately handle the case when the matrix has an odd dimension, leading to the double counting of the center element.

Correctness: **False**.
