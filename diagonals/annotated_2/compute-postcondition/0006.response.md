Example Answer:
The code snippet adds the value of the diagonal element at index (i, i) to the `total`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, the new `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1**
