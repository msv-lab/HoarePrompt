Example Answer:
`total` is updated by adding the value of the diagonal element at index (i, i) in the `matrix`. The value of `i` is increased by 1 after this operation. It is important to note that `n` is greater than `i`, so the index (i, i) is within the bounds of the square matrix. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`**
