Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the square matrix `matrix`. Since the matrix is of dimension n x n, the value of `n` is equal to the number of rows or columns in the matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, and `n` is equal to the number of rows or columns in the matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, and `n` is equal to the number of rows or columns in the matrix**
