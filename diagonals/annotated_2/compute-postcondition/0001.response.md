Example Answer:
The variable `total` is initialized to 0. Since the code snippet does not modify any variables or perform any calculations, the value of `total` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, and `n` is equal to the number of rows or columns in the matrix; `total` is 0.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, and `n` is equal to the number of rows or columns in the matrix; `total` is 0**
