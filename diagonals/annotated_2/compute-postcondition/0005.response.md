According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n where n is a non-negative integer and n is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value. 
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n where n is a non-negative integer and n is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+2)th index, `i` is increased by 1**
