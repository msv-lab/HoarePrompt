According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n` after increasing it by 1. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than `n` and `n` must still be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1 and is less than `n`, `n` is greater than `i`**
