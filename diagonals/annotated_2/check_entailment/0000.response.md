Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. It iterates through the matrix, adding the diagonal elements and the reverse diagonal elements to the total sum. The annotations also confirm that the code handles the case where the matrix is of dimension 0, in which case the total sum remains 0. The code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
