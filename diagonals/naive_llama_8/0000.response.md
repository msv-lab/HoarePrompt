Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The program works by iterating over the rows of the matrix and adding the elements at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) and the element at the current row and the column index mirrored across the center of the matrix (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum.

The program handles the case where the matrix is a single element (1x1 matrix) correctly, as well as the case where the matrix has an even or odd number of rows.

One potential edge case that could be considered is a matrix with zero rows (i.e., an empty matrix). However, the program correctly handles this case by returning 0, since the sum of no elements is 0.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases correctly.
