Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(matrix)` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function iterates over the rows of the matrix, adding the elements at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) and the elements at the current row and the mirrored column index (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum.

The function handles square matrices of any dimension n√ón correctly, as it uses the length of the matrix (`n`) to determine the number of rows and columns. The loop iterates over the rows, and the column indices are calculated based on the row index, ensuring that all elements along both diagonals are included in the sum.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles the calculation of the sum of elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, without adding any element twice.
