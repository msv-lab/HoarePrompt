Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention that the function calculates the sum of diagonal elements by summing the elements along both the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal. However, the code only adds the elements along these diagonals one time, not ensuring that no element is added twice.

For example, consider a 2x2 matrix:
```
[[1, 2],
 [3, 4]]
```
The correct sum of both diagonals should be 10, but the code would calculate 1 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 10, which adds the elements at (0, 0) and (1, 1) twice.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the case where no element can be added twice, as required by the problem description.
