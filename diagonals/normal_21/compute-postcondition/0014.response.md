The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix and assigns it to the variable `total`. The function also returns the value of `n`, which is the size of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix `matrix` of size n x n, calculate the sum of diagonal elements, and return the total sum along with the size of the matrix.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of size n x n, calculates the sum of diagonal elements, and returns the total sum along with the size of the matrix.**
