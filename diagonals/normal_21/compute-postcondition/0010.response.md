Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The specific values of `total`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, so the output state will depend on the specific values in the `matrix`.
Output State: **The final state of `total`, `i`, and `n` will depend on the specific values in the `matrix`**
