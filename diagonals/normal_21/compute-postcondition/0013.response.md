Output State: 
If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 0 or `matrix` is empty):
`total` remains 0, `i` is 0, `n` is 0.

If the loop executes:
`total` is the sum of diagonal elements of `matrix`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the size of the matrix.
Output State: **`total` is the sum of diagonal elements of `matrix`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the size of the matrix**
