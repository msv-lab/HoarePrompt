Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation. The value of `n` would also be adjusted accordingly based on the new value of `i`. Since the initial state values of `total`, `i`, and `n` are unknown, the output state will reflect the changes made by updating `total` and adjusting `n` based on the incremented value of `i`.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value of `matrix[i][i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is adjusted accordingly**
