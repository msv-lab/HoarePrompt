According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final state of `total`, `i`, and `n` will depend on the specific values in the `matrix`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to analyze the specific values in the `matrix` and determine if `i` is less than `n` based on those values. Make sure to update the relevant states accordingly.
State: **The final state of `total`, `i`, and `n` based on the specific values in the `matrix`**
