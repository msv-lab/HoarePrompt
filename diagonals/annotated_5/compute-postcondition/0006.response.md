Example Answer:
`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]` where `i` is 1. The value of `total` is already increased by the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]`. The dimensions of the square matrix `matrix` are n x n. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `total` will be the sum of the previous total, `matrix[1][n - 2]`, and `matrix[1][1]`. 
Output State: **`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]` and `matrix[1][1] is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n`**
