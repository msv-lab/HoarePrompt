According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is increased by the sum of values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 as it moves to the next iteration and `total` should be updated based on the new values in the diagonal of the matrix.
State: **`total` is updated with the new sum of values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1**
