Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal of the matrix is added to `total`. Variable `i` is then incremented by 2. Variable `n` is compared to the new value of `i + 1`. No information about the initial values of `total`, `i`, and `n` is provided, so the output state is: `total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 2, `n` is greater than the new value of `i + 1`.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 2, `n` is greater than the new value of `i + 1`**
