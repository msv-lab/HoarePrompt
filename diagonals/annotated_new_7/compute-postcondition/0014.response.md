The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. The function updates the variable `total` based on the values at the diagonals of the matrix. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square 2D list of integers `matrix` with dimensions n x n, update the variable `total` based on the values at the diagonals of the matrix, and keep `total` as 0 if n is less than or equal to 0.
