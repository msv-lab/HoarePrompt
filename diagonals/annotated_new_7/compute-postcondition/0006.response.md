Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal of the matrix is added to `total`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. If `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, the process continues. 
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`**
