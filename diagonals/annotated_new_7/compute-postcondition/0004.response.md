Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal of the matrix is added to the total. The value of `i` and `n` are unknown, but the matrix is assumed to be a square matrix. Therefore, the value at the diagonal position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is added to the total. 
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix**
