According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`**
