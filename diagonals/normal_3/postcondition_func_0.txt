The function func_1 accepts a parameter `matrix` representing a matrix. It calculates the total by summing the diagonal elements of the matrix. The function returns the final value of total after the calculations. If the matrix is empty (n=0) or negative, the total remains 0. The function does not handle cases where the matrix is not square (i.e., number of rows is not equal to the number of columns), potentially leading to index out of range errors.
