Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. The value of `n` is greater than 0, so `n - i - 1` is a valid index. After the addition, the new value of `total` is calculated. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `i` is 0**
