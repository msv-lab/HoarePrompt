Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the matrix size is odd. Specifically, the center element of the matrix gets added twiceâ€”once when summing the main diagonal and once when summing the secondary diagonal. 

For example, consider the following 3x3 matrix:

```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

In this case, the main diagonal elements are 1, 5, and 9, and the secondary diagonal elements are 3, 5, and 7. The current implementation would calculate the sum as:

```
1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 30
```

However, the center element (5) is counted twice. The correct sum should be:

```
1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
```

Thus, the program does not correctly calculate the sum of the elements along both diagonals without double-counting the center element in odd-sized matrices.
