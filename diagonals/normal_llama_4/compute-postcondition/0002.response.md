To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `n` must be greater than 0, because the loop will not execute if `n` is 0.
* `i` is 0, because the loop starts from the first iteration.

The state of `matrix` being a 2D list representing a square matrix and `total` being 0 are already given, and they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
