The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `matrix[i][i]` is `matrix[1][1]`. The initial value of `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`. Therefore, the new value of `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`.**
