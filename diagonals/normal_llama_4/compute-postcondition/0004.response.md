The code adds the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to `total`. Since `i` is 0, the value added to `total` is `matrix[0][n - 1]`. The state of `matrix` and `n` remains the same, and `i` is still 0. The value of `total` is updated.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.**
