Based on the annotated code and the return postconditions, I understand that the function `func_1` accepts a 2D list representing a square matrix as input.

Here's my analysis:

* The function calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.
* If the matrix is not empty (i.e., `n` is greater than 0), the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.
* If the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the function returns 0.

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that the annotations and the code match in terms of functionality. The code correctly calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, and returns 0 if the matrix is empty.

However, I did notice that the code does not handle cases where the input matrix is not a square matrix. If the input matrix is not square, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results. Therefore, I will include this potential edge case in the functionality summary.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list representing a square matrix, calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, and returns the sum if the matrix is not empty; otherwise, it returns 0. If the input matrix is not square, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results. **
