The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, where each inner list has the same length as the outer list, and all elements in the matrix are numbers. After executing the function body, if the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix; otherwise, it returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix and return the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix is not empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix and returns the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix is not empty; otherwise, it returns 0.**
