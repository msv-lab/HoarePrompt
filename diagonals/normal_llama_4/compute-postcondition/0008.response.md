To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

The current state is:
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n - 2]`

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, we need to adjust `i` to be 2 for the loop to execute again.

However, we also need to consider the relationship between `i` and `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. 

The state of `matrix` and `total` does not affect the loop's execution, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n - 2]`**
