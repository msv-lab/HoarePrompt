The function returns `total`, and `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `total` is 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is the same as the initial state, and the function returns the value of `total`.

Output State: **`total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `total` is 0, `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, and the function returns `total`.**
