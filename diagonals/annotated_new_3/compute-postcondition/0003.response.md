Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at the diagonal position `matrix[i][i]` in the square matrix. As `i` is initialized to 0, the value at the first position of the diagonal is added to `total`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the value at the diagonal position of the first row and column, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the value at the diagonal position of the first row and column, `i` is 0**
