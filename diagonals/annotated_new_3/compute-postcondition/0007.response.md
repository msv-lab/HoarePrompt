Example Answer: 
The value at matrix[i][n - i - 1] is added to the total. The value of i is 1, so the element accessed is matrix[1][n - 1 - 1]. Since matrix is a square matrix, the element accessed is from the diagonal of the matrix. The total is updated based on this diagonal element. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated based on the diagonal element, i is 1.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated based on the diagonal element, i is 1**
