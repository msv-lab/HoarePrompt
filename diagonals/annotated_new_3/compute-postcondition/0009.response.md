Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the diagonal element at position (2, 2) in the matrix. Since `i` is 2, it means we are accessing the element at the third row and third column. After adding this value to `total`, the new value of `total` is determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 2**
