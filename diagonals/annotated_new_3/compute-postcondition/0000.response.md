Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix, which is a square matrix. Since the matrix is a square matrix (n x n), the length of the matrix will give the value of `n`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. `n` is the length of the matrix**.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. `n` is the length of the matrix**.
