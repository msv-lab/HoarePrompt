According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, total being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer and `i` is 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
