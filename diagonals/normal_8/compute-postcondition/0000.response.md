Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix, which is the number of rows in the square matrix. Since the matrix is square (n x n), the number of rows is equal to the number of columns, hence `n` represents the size of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value**
