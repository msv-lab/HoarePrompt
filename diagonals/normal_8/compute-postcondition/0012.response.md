Output State: 
The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix `matrix` by iterating through the rows and columns. The variable `total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements in each iteration. The loop will execute for a square matrix with size `n x n` where `n` is a positive integer. If the matrix is not square or if `n` is not greater than 0, the loop will not execute and `total` will remain its initial value.

If the loop executes, `total` will be increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix in each iteration.
If the loop does not execute, `total` will remain its initial value.

Output State: **If the loop executes, total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If the loop does not execute, total remains its initial value.**
