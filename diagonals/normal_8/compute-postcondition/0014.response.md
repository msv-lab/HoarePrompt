The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0. Each element of the matrix is a numerical value. After executing the function body, if the loop executes, the variable `total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If the loop does not execute, `total` remains its initial value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix `matrix` and update the variable `total` by adding the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix if the loop executes. If the loop does not execute, `total` remains unchanged.
