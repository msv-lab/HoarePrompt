Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. The diagonal elements are accessed using the indices `[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the output state is: matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value; `total` is increased by the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value; `total` is increased by the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix**
