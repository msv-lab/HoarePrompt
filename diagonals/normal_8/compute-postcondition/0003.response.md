Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i]`, which is the diagonal element of the square matrix. The previous values of `total` and the matrix elements are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value, `total` is increased by the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value, `total` is increased by the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix**
