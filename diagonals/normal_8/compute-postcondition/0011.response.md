According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix and `i` is incremented by 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and compared to `n` to determine if the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix; `i` is incremented by 2**
