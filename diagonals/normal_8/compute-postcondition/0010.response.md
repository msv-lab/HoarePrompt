Example Answer:
The total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix, which is accessed by `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous values of `total` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix; `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix; `i` is incremented by 1**
