To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

**Problem description:** Write a function matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix) that calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The matrix may be of any dimension n×n. When the sum is calculated no element of the matrix can be added twice.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

### Analysis:
1. The program iterates through the indices of the matrix and sums up the elements along both the primary diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the secondary diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`).
2. However, when the matrix is of odd dimensions (for example, a 3x3 matrix), the center element will be counted twice since it belongs to both diagonals. For a 3x3 matrix, `matrix[1][1]` will be added in both iterations when `i` is 1.

### Example Case:
Consider the following 3x3 matrix:
```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
- Primary diagonal: 1, 5, 9 → Sum = 15
- Secondary diagonal: 3, 5, 7 → Sum = 15
- Expected sum = 15 + 15 - 5 (to avoid double counting) = 25

Using the provided program:
- When `i=0`: `total += matrix[0][0]` (1), `total += matrix[0][2]` (3) → total = 4
- When `i=1`: `total += matrix[1][1]` (5), `total += matrix[1][1]` (5 again) → total = 14
- When `i=2`: `total += matrix[2][2]` (9), `total += matrix[2][0]` (7) → total = 30

The final result will be 30, which is incorrect as it does not account for the double counting of the center element.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the matrix has an odd dimension, resulting in double-counting the center element of the matrix. 

Correctness: **False**.
