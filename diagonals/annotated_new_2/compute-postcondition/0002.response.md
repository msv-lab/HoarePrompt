According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n, and `total` is 0. To ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, and `total` remains at 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, `total` is 0**
