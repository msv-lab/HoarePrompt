Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is incremented by the sum of the diagonal element at position (i, n - i - 1) in the matrix. The value of `i` ranges from 0 to n-1. After the code execution, the total will be updated accordingly with the sum of the diagonal elements. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
