The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and the total sum remains 0. The function then returns the final value of the total sum calculated from the diagonal elements of the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n, calculates the sum of the diagonal elements. If n is 0, the function returns 0.**
