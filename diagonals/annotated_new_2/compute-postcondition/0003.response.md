Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value at the diagonal element `matrix[i][i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to n-1. The previous value of `total` is 0. After execution, `total` will be the sum of all diagonal elements of the `matrix`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, `total` is the sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
