Example Answer:
The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix `matrix` of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. The function then returns the final value of `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix `matrix` of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. The function then returns the final value of `total`.
