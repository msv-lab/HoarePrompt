Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a square matrix of integers and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements as per the problem description. 
The code iterates through the rows of the matrix and calculates the sum of elements at positions (i, i) and (i, n - i - 1) for each row. This covers both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. 
The annotations provide a clear explanation of what the code is doing and how it calculates the sum of diagonal elements. 
Based on the code and annotations, it can be concluded that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
