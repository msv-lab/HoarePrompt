According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. This means the loop can execute again. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0, `i` is 1**
