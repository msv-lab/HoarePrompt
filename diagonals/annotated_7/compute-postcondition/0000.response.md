Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n. Since `matrix` is a square 2D list, the length of the matrix will give the dimension of the matrix, which is the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the dimension of the square matrix**.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the dimension of the square matrix**.
