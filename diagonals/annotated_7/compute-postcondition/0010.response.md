Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` where `i` ranges from 0 to 2. The initial value of `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0 plus `matrix[2][2]` plus `matrix[2][n - 2 - 1]` plus the value of `matrix[2][2]` as `i` equals 2. The new value of `total` will be the previous total plus `matrix[0][n]`, `matrix[1][n - 1]`, and `matrix[2][n - 2]`. The dimensions of `matrix` are n x n, so `i` ranges from 0 to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `total` is updated according to the mentioned formula.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated according to the mentioned formula**
