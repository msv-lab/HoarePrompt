The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The precondition is that `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. If n is 0, the total remains 0. If n is greater than 0, the total is updated with the sum of diagonal elements of the square matrix, and the function returns the final value of total. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, calculate the sum of diagonal elements if n is greater than 0, and return the final total. If n is 0, the total remains 0. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, calculates the sum of diagonal elements if n is greater than 0, and returns the final total. If n is 0, the total remains 0.**
