According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, so it implies that the matrix is valid for the loop. However, the `total` being 0 does not impact the loop execution directly. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
