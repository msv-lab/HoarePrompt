Example Answer:
If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and total remains 0. If n is greater than 0, the loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix and updates total accordingly. The function returns the final value of total.
Output State: **If n is 0, total remains 0. If n is greater than 0, total is updated with the sum of diagonal elements of the square matrix, and the function returns the final value of total.**
