Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at the position `(i, n - i - 1)` in the `matrix` for each iteration. The value of `n` is the size of the square matrix, so the index `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. After running the code, the sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix will be added to `total`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix**
