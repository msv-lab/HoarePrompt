Example Answer:
The value at position `[i][n-i-1]` in the matrix is added to the `total`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The states of `matrix`, `total`, and `i` are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is `i+1`**
