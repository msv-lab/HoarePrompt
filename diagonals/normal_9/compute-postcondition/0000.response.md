Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the square matrix `matrix`. Since `matrix` is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `n` will be the side length of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, and `n` is the side length of the square matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `n` is the side length of the square matrix**
