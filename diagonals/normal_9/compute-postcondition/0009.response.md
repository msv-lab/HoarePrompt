Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the diagonal element at position `(i, i)` in the matrix. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is `i+1`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is `i+1`**
