Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer. It calculates the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix and returns the total sum. If n is 0, the function returns 0 as the total sum. The function iterates through the diagonal elements of the matrix and accumulates their values to calculate the total sum. **

In this case, the annotations accurately describe the functionality of the code. There are no missing edge cases or functionalities.
