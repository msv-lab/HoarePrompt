Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` tries to calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by iterating through the diagonal elements of the matrix and accumulating their values. However, the code is adding the elements from both diagonals to the `total`, which results in some elements being added twice. This violates the condition in the problem description that states "no element of the matrix can be added twice." Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
