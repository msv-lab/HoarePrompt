The function accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix, calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, and returns the sum. However, it assumes the input matrix is square and does not handle non-square matrices, which will result in an IndexError. If the input matrix is empty, it returns 0.
