The code adds the value of the element at position `[i][n - i - 1]` in the `matrix` to the `total`. The value of `i` is 0, so the element being added is at position `[0][n - 1]`, which is the top-right element of the `matrix`. The value of `total` is initially the top-left element of the `matrix`, and it will be updated to be the sum of the top-left and top-right elements.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 0**
