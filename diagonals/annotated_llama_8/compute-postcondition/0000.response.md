To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code `n = len(matrix)` assigns the length of the `matrix` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, the length of `matrix` is equal to the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Given the initial state that `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix, we can infer that `n` will be assigned the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix**
