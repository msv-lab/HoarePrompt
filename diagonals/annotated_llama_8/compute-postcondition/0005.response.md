According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
