According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix and `total` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
