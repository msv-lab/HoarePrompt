The code adds the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to `total`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` refers to the second element of the second row of `matrix`. The value of `total` is increased by this element.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, middle elements of the first row of `matrix` and the second element of the second row of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
