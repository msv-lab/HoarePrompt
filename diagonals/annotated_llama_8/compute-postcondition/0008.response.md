To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` being greater than 1 is not sufficient. `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` must be incremented.

Since `i` is 1, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `matrix` and `total` does not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, middle elements of the first row of `matrix` and the second element of the second row of `matrix`, `i` is 2**
