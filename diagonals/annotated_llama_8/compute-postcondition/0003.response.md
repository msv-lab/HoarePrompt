`total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. Since `i` is 0, `matrix[i][i]` refers to the top-left element of the matrix. The value of this element is unknown, but it is an integer. Therefore, `total` becomes the value of this top-left element.

The output state is: `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value of the top-left element of `matrix`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value of the top-left element of `matrix`, `i` is 0**
