To analyze the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** The function `matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix)` calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The matrix may be of any dimension n×n, and no element of the matrix can be added twice.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program initializes a variable `total` to zero.
2. It then iterates over the range of `n`, which is the size of the matrix.
3. For each index `i`, it adds the element at `matrix[i][i]` (the main diagonal) and the element at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` (the secondary diagonal) to `total`.
4. Finally, it returns `total`.

**Issue Identification:**
The main problem arises when the matrix size is odd. In such cases, the center element of the matrix (which is at position `(n//2, n//2)`) will be counted twice: once for the main diagonal and once for the secondary diagonal. This violates the requirement that no element of the matrix can be added twice.

**Example Case:**
Consider a 3x3 matrix:
```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
- The main diagonal elements are: `1, 5, 9` → sum = 15
- The secondary diagonal elements are: `3, 5, 7` → sum = 15
- The center element `5` is added twice.

Total calculated by the program: `15 + 15 = 30`, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25`.

**Conclusion:**
The program fails to handle the case when the matrix size is odd, leading to double counting of the center element.

Correctness: **False**.
