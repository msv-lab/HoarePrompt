To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description. 

**Problem description**: Write a function `matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix)` that calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The matrix may be of any dimension n√ón. When the sum is calculated, no element of the matrix can be added twice.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

**Analysis**:
1. The function initializes a variable `total` to zero and iterates over the range of the matrix's size `n`.
2. In each iteration, it adds the element at the primary diagonal position (`matrix[i][i]`) and the secondary diagonal position (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to `total`.
3. The issue arises when the size of the matrix is odd. In such cases, the center element of the matrix is counted twice because it belongs to both diagonals.

**Counterexample**:
- Consider the matrix:
  ```
  [[1, 2, 3],
   [4, 5, 6],
   [7, 8, 9]]
  ```
  Here, the primary diagonal elements are `1`, `5`, and `9`, and the secondary diagonal elements are `3`, `5`, and `7`. When using the program:
  - `total` will be calculated as `1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 30`.
  - However, the center element `5` is counted twice, which should not happen according to the problem description.

**Conclusion**:
The program does not handle the case where the matrix size is odd properly, leading to a double count of the center element along both diagonals.

Correctness: **False**.
