To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0

The code is: `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]`

Since `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. 

So, the code effectively becomes: `total += matrix[0][n - 1]`

Given that `total` initially is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, after the execution, `total` will be the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The states of the other variables (`matrix`, `n`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0**
