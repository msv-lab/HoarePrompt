To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers
- `n` is greater than 1
- `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n - 2]`
- `i` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 to guarantee another iteration. However, since `n` is already greater than 1, we only need to increment `i` to the next value to ensure the loop can execute again.

The state of `matrix` and the calculation of `total` do not directly affect the loop's condition (`i` in range of `n`). Therefore, these states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

However, considering the loop's nature and the fact that `i` has been used to index into `matrix` in the calculation of `total`, it's reasonable to assume that `i`'s value is relevant to the loop's body (even though the body is omitted). Thus, incrementing `i` is necessary for the loop to progress.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 2**
