Based on the initial state, the function returns the value of `total`. If `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If `n` is 0, `total` is 0. The state of the other variables does not change.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `n` is `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, and the function returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If `n` is 0, `n` is 0, `i` is not defined, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, and the function returns 0.**
