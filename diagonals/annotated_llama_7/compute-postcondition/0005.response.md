To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0 and the loop can execute again, `i` should be incremented to 1. However, the value of `n` also needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, `n` should be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `matrix` and `total` does not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 1**
