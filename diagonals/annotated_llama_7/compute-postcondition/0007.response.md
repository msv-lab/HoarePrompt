Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code is `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. 

The initial state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1.

Since `i` is 1, `n - i - 1` is `n - 2`. 

The value of `total` is increased by `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, which is `matrix[1][n - 2]`.

The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not changed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 1**
