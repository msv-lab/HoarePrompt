To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 1.

The code `total += matrix[i][i]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is 1.

Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][i]` is equivalent to `matrix[1][1]`. The value of `matrix[1][1]` is unknown, but it is an integer.

The new value of `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` (which is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`) and `matrix[1][1]`.

The states of the other variables (`matrix`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1**
