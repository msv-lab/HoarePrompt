Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, but it does not specify what should happen if the input matrix is not square. However, the code annotations mention that if the input matrix is not square, the function may raise an `IndexError`. This implies that the code does not handle non-square matrices correctly.

In particular, if the input matrix is not square, the code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` for some `i`. This is because `n` is the number of rows in the matrix, but the number of columns may be different. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for non-square matrices.

The annotations were helpful in identifying this issue, as they mentioned the possibility of an `IndexError` for non-square matrices. However, the annotations also mention that the function returns 0 for an empty matrix, which is consistent with the problem description.

To fix this issue, the code should add a check to ensure that the input matrix is square before attempting to calculate the sum of the diagonals. If the matrix is not square, the code should raise a meaningful error or return a special value to indicate that the input is invalid.
