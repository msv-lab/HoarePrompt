Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the diagonal elements by summing the elements at the primary diagonal index `i` and the secondary diagonal index `n - i - 1`. However, this approach may lead to adding the elements of the secondary diagonal multiple times when `i == n - i - 1` for odd values of `n`. For example, in a 3x3 matrix, the element at indices (0,2) and (2,0) will be added twice to the total sum. This violates the condition that no element of the matrix can be added twice.
