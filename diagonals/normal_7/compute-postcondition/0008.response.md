According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 2**
