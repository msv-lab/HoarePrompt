Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of the `matrix` is added to the `total`. Since `i` is 2, the element at index 2,2 of the `matrix` is added to the `total`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 2**
