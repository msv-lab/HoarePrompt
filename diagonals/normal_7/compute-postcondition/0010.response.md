Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is used to index the matrix at position `i` and `n - i - 1`, which is then added to `total`. The previous values of `n`, `total`, and `i` are known. After execution, the value of `total` will be further updated according to the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 2**
