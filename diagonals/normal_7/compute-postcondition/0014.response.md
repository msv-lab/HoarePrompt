The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix. Each element of the matrix is an integer. After executing the function body, the function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix and stores it in a variable `total`. The function then returns the value of `total`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix `matrix`, calculate the sum of the diagonal elements, and return the total sum. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix where each element is an integer, calculates the sum of the diagonal elements, and returns the total sum.**
