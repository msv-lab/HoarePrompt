Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the matrix. Since the matrix is a square matrix with n rows and n columns, the value of `n` is equal to the number of rows or columns in the matrix. Therefore, after execution, `n` holds the value of the number of rows or columns in the square matrix.
Output State: **`n` is the number of rows or columns in the square matrix**
