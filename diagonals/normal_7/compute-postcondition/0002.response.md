According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, n is the number of rows or columns in the square matrix, and total is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
