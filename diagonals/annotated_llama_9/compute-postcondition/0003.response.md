The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `matrix[i][i]` is `matrix[0][0]`. The value of `matrix[0][0]` is an integer, but its exact value is unknown. Therefore, the value of `total` is incremented by an unknown integer.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `total` is the sum of the initial value of `total` (which is 0) and `matrix[0][0]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is `matrix[0][0]`.**
