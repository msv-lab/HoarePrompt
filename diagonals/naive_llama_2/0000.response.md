Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(matrix)` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function iterates over the rows of the matrix, adding the elements at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) and the elements at the current row and the mirrored column index (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum. This approach ensures that each element along both diagonals is added exactly once to the total sum.

The function assumes that the input matrix is a square matrix (i.e., it has the same number of rows and columns), which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. If the input matrix is not square, the function may not work correctly. However, this is not a case that the problem description explicitly mentions, and it is a common assumption in matrix-related problems that the input matrix is square unless otherwise stated.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
