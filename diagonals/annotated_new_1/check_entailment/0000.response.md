Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description. While it correctly calculates the sum of diagonal elements in a square matrix, it does not handle cases where the input matrix is not a square matrix. The problem description clearly states that the matrix may be of any dimension n√ón, but the code assumes that the input matrix is always a square matrix. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description. The annotations confirm this by mentioning that the code does not handle cases where the input matrix is not a square matrix.
