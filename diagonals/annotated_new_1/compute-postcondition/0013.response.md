Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will iterate over the diagonal elements of the square matrix and update the total by adding the diagonal elements at current ith and (n - i - 1)th indices. After the loop executes, total will be the sum of all diagonal elements, i will be n, and n will still be the side length of the square matrix. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and total will remain 0. The function returns the total.**
