Example Answer:
The code snippet adds the value of the element at the ith row and ith column of the matrix to the `total` variable. Since `i` is increased by 1, the (i+1)th element of the diagonal is added to `total`. Therefore, the new `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th element. The dimensions of the matrix remain the same. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix up to the new (i+1)th element, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
