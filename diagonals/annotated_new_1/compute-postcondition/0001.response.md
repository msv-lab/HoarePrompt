Example Answer: 
The variable `total` is initialized to 0. Since there are no other variables or operations affecting the state, the output state is simply `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is the side length of the square matrix, and `total` is 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is 0**
