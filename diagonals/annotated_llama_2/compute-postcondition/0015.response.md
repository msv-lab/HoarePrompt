Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers. The function calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. `n = len(matrix)`: This line calculates the length of the inner lists of the matrix, which is also the length of the outer list.
2. `total = 0`: This line initializes a variable `total` to 0.
3. The `for` loop iterates over the rows of the matrix. For each row `i`, it adds the element at position `(i, i)` (main diagonal) and `(i, n - i - 1)` (anti-diagonal) to the `total` variable.
4. After the loop, the function returns the `total` variable.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop doesn't execute, and the function returns 0. This is correctly handled by the code.
* If the matrix is not square (i.e., the inner lists have different lengths), the code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. This is not handled by the code, and it's not clear what the expected behavior should be in this case.
* If the matrix contains non-integer values, the code will still work, but the result may not be meaningful.

Based on the code and the return postconditions, here is a concise summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square 2D list of integers `matrix` and returns the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements. If the matrix is empty, it returns 0. However, if the matrix is not square, it will raise an `IndexError`. **
