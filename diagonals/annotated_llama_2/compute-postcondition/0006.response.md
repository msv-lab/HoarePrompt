To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `total` is `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1]`.

2. **Code to Execute**:
   - `total += matrix[i][i]`

3. **Analysis**:
   - The code adds the value at `matrix[i][i]` to `total`.
   - Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][i]` refers to `matrix[1][1]`.
   - The new value of `total` will be the sum of its original value (`matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1]`) and `matrix[1][1]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `matrix` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
   - `n` remains greater than 1, unchanged.
   - `i` remains 1, unchanged.
   - `total` is now `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.**
