The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. Since `i` is 0, `matrix[i][i]` is the value at the first row and first column of the matrix. The initial value of `total` is 0, so the new value of `total` is the value at `matrix[0][0]`. The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not changed.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is `matrix[0][0]`.**
