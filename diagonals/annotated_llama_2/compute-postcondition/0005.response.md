According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute again. The state of `matrix` and `total` does not affect the loop execution, but `total` may need to be updated based on the new value of `i`. Assuming the loop body calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the current row, `total` would be updated to `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1]`.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1]`.**
