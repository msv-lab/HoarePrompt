Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is 1. The previous value of `total` is unknown, but since `i` is 1, the value of `matrix[1][1]` will be added to `total`. Therefore, the updated `total` will be the current `total` plus `matrix[1][1]`, and `i` will remain 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1**
