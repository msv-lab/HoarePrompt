The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The parameter `matrix` represents a matrix. If the value of `n` is greater than 0, the function will execute a loop to calculate the total by adding the diagonal elements of the matrix. The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`. If the value of `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and the total will remain 0. The function returns the final value of the total after performing the calculations based on the conditions mentioned above.
