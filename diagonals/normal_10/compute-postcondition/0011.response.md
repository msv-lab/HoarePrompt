According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[2][2]`, and `matrix[2][n - 3]`, `i` is 2. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[2][2]`, and `matrix[2][n - 3]`, `i` is 2**
