Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at index `i` in the `matrix` to it. The value of `i` is 0, so the value at `matrix[0][0]` is added to `total`. Since the initial state of `total` is 0, the value at `matrix[0][0]` will be added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value at `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value at `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0**
