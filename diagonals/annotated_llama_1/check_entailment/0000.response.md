Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the code and the annotations, and I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, and it handles the case where the input matrix is empty.

The annotations provide a clear explanation of the state of the program at each point, and they highlight the assumptions made by the function, such as the input matrix being square and containing integers. The annotations also mention the possibility of an `IndexError` being raised if the input matrix is not square, and a `TypeError` being raised if the matrix contains non-integer values.

I have checked the code against the problem description, and I believe that it meets all the requirements. The function correctly calculates the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, and it returns 0 if the input matrix is empty.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing a clear understanding of the program's state at each point, and by highlighting the assumptions made by the function. This helped me to identify potential edge cases and to verify that the code correctly handles them.

Overall, I believe that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
