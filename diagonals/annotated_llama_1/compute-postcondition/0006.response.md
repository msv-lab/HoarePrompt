The value of `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so the value at `matrix[i][i]` is `matrix[1][1]`. The value of `total` was the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`, so the new value of `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1**
