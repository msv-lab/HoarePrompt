The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, meaning the number of rows is equal to the number of columns in each row. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square list of lists of integers `matrix` and return the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square list of lists of integers `matrix` and returns the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements.**
