To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]`.
- `i` is 1.

The loop condition is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` (which will be incremented) remains less than `n`. However, the fact that `n` is greater than 1 is already given and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. The critical point is that `i` needs to be less than `n` for the loop to continue, and since `i` will be incremented, we consider its next value.

The adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is in the understanding of `n` relative to `i`. Given `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (to ensure `i` is less than `n` after incrementing `i`). However, since we already know `n` is greater than 1, the condition that `n` is greater than 1 already covers the requirement for the loop to execute again with `i` being 2.

Therefore, the state adjustments are:
- `i` needs to be incremented to reflect the next iteration, so `i` is 2.
- The condition on `n` does not need to be adjusted because knowing `n` is greater than 1 is sufficient for the loop to potentially execute again with `i` being 2.
- The state of `matrix` and the calculation of `total` do not directly influence the loop's continuation condition based on `i` and `n`.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 2**
