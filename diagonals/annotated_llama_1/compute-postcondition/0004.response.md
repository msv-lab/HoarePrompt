Let's think step by step:

The code `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]` increments the value of `total` by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

From the initial state, we know that `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]`, and `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0, `n - i - 1` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, the code increments `total` by the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The value of `total` is now the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not changed.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0**
