According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers and `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
