The function returns `total`, and `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`, and the function returns the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`.

Output State: **`total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`, and the function returns the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`.**
