To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Currently, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 2 is not sufficient. `n` must be greater than 3.

The state of `matrix` and `total` does not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3, since it will be incremented at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 3, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2] + matrix[2][n - 3]`, `i` is 3**
