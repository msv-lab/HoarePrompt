Let's break down the code and annotations step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers.
2. The code calculates the length of the matrix (`n = len(matrix)`) and initializes a variable `total` to 0.
3. The code then iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop (`for i in range(n)`).
4. Inside the loop, the code adds the elements on the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the anti-diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the `total` variable.
5. After the loop finishes, the code returns the `total` variable.

Now, let's analyze the annotations and potential edge cases:

* The annotations state that if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` is 0. This is correct, as the loop condition `range(n)` will be empty if `n` is 0.
* The annotations state that if `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. This is also correct, as the loop iterates over the rows of the matrix and adds the corresponding elements to `total`.
* However, the annotations do not mention what happens if the input matrix is not square (i.e., if the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns). In this case, the code will still execute, but the result may not be what the user expects.
* Another potential edge case is if the input matrix contains non-integer values. In this case, the code will still execute, but the result may not be what the user expects.

Based on this analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square 2D list of integers as a parameter and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If the input matrix is not square, the function will still execute, but the result may not be what the user expects. If the input matrix contains non-integer values, the function will still execute, but the result may not be what the user expects. **
