Let's break down the code and its impact on the program.

The code `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]` increments the value of `total` by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. So, `n - i - 1` is equal to `n - 2`.

Therefore, the code is adding the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]` to `total`.

The initial value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`. After the code executes, the new value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`.

The states of the other variables (`matrix` and `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 1**
