To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code is: `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]`

From the initial state, we know:
- `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `total` is `matrix[0][0]`.
- `i` is 0.

Given `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`.

So, the code effectively becomes `total += matrix[0][n - 1]`.

Since `total` initially is `matrix[0][0]`, after the execution, `total` will be the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The output state is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0**
