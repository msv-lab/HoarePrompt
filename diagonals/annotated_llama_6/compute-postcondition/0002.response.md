To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. In this case, the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already defined as `x`, and `x` is the number of rows and columns in the square 2D list `matrix`, we can infer that `n` (or `x`) must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, `total` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the starting point of the loop.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
