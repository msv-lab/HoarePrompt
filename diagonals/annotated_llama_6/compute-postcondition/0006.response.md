To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.
- `i` is 1.

The code to execute is:
```python
total += matrix[i][i]
```

Now, let's think step by step:
- The value of `i` is 1.
- We need to add `matrix[i][i]` to `total`. Since `i` is 1, we are adding `matrix[1][1]` to `total`.
- The initial value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.
- After adding `matrix[1][1]` to `total`, the new value of `total` becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.

The output state is:
- `matrix` is still a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`.
- `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1**
