Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, but the code does not check if the input matrix is indeed square. If the input matrix is not square, the function will still execute, but the result may not be what the user expects.

The annotations also mention this case, stating that "If the input matrix is not square, the function will still execute, but the result may not be what the user expects." This suggests that the code does not handle non-square matrices correctly.

For example, if the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], which is not square, the function will return 9 (1 + 5 + 3 + 6), which is not the correct sum of the elements along both diagonals.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by highlighting this potential edge case, which I then verified by checking the code. I also checked the problem description to confirm that it requires the input matrix to be square.

If the code were modified to check if the input matrix is square and raise an error if it is not, it would be correct. However, in its current form, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
