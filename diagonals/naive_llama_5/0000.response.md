Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(matrix)` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function iterates over the rows of the matrix, adding the elements at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) and the elements at the current row and the mirrored column index (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum.

This approach ensures that each element along both diagonals is added exactly once to the total sum, meeting the requirements of the problem description. The function handles square matrices of any dimension n√ón correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code, it is concluded that the function `func_1(matrix)` correctly implements the desired functionality, and the correctness is **True**.
