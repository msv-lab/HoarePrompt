Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix by accessing elements at positions (i, i) and (i, n - i - 1) for each row. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute for n times, updating the total with the sum of diagonal elements. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the total will remain 0.**
