According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3. Since the loop starts from 2, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4**
