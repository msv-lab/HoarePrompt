According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), and `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1` since the matrix is of size (n+1) x (n+1). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix, `i` is less than n+1**
