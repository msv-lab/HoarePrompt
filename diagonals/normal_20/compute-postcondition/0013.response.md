Example Answer: 
The function returns the total sum of diagonal elements calculated in the loop. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes for `n` times, updating the total with the sum of diagonal elements. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the total remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The total sum of diagonal elements calculated in the loop is returned.
Output State: **The total sum of diagonal elements calculated in the loop is returned**
