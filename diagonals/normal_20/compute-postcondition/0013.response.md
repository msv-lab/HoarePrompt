Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2. If `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and int(num), the function returns True**
