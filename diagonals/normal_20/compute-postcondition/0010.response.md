Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at the position `[i][n - i - 1]` of the matrix. The value of `i` ranges from 0 to n, so this operation is performed n+1 times. After each iteration, the sum of the diagonal elements is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix after adding matrix[i][i], and `i` is less than n+1.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix after adding matrix[i][i], and `i` is less than n+1**
