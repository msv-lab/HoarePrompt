Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the diagonal element at position `(i, i)` of the `matrix`. Since `matrix` is a square matrix of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`, `i` varies from 0 to `n`. After running the code, the sum of all diagonal elements will be added to the previous value of `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
