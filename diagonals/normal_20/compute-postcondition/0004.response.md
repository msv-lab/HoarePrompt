Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. This means that the value at the diagonal position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is added to `total`. Since `matrix` is a square matrix, this operation updates the sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
