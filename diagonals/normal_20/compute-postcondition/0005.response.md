According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 to move to the next iteration.
State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
