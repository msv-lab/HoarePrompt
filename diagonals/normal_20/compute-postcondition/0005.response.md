According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
