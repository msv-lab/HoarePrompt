Example Answer:
`total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. After the calculation, the new value of `total` will depend on the specific elements of the matrix. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
