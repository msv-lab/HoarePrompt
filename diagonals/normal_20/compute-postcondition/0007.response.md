Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at position `[i][n - i - 1]` of the matrix in each iteration of the loop. Since the matrix is a square matrix, the sum is updated by adding the diagonal elements. The `total` variable is modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
