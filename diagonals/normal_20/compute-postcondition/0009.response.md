Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at the ith row and ith column of the `matrix` to itself. The value of `i` is less than n+1, so it is a valid index for the square matrix. After execution, the sum of all diagonal elements in the `matrix` is added to the previous value of `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix after adding matrix[i][i], and `i` is less than n+1.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix after adding matrix[i][i], and `i` is less than n+1**
