The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer. 

Case_1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case_2: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2. If `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and int(num), the function returns True.

Case_3: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2. If `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and int(num), the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept an integer `num` and return True if `num` is a prime number, and False if it is not. If `num` is less than 2, it returns False.
