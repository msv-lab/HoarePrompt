Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is incremented by the element at the diagonal position (i, i) in the square matrix `matrix`. Since `matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, the code snippet iterates over the diagonal elements of the matrix and adds them to the `total`. The previous value of `total` is 0. After executing the code, the `total` will be the sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is the sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
