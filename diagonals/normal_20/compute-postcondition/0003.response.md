Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is increased by the value in the `matrix` at index `[i][i]`. Since the initial value of `total` is 0, and `i` is 0, the value of `total` is updated to the value at `matrix[0][0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated to the value at `matrix[0][0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated to the value at `matrix[0][0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
