Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix which is the number of rows/columns in the square matrix. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix**
