Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, where `len(matrix)` returns the number of rows in the square matrix. Since the matrix is a square matrix (n x n), the number of rows is equal to the number of columns, so `n` represents the size of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0; `n` represents the size of the square matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0; `n` represents the size of the square matrix**
