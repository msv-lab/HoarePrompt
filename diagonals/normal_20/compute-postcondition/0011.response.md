According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3**
