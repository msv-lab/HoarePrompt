According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4. If `num` is divisible by 4, the function returns False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should increment `i` by 1 to move to the next value within the range.
State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 5**
