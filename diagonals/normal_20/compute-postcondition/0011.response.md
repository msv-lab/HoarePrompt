According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix after adding matrix[i][i], and `i` is less than n+1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i+1`.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix after adding matrix[i][i], and `i` is less than n+1**
