According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is at least 2. The loop will iterate from 2 to the square root of `num`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is the upper limit of the loop.
State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is the upper limit of the loop**
