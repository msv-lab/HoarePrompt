According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `total` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0 and `n` represents the size of the square matrix.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, `total` is 0**
