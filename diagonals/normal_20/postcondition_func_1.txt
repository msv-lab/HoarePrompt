The function `is_prime` accepts an integer `num` and checks if `num` is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, it iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `num` and if `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any number in the range, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number.
