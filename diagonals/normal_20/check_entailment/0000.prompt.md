You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \\le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.\n\nFor example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \\le l \\le r < 10^{18}, 1 \\le k \\le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 50 2\n\nOutput\n1230\n\nInput\n1 2345 10\n\nOutput\n2750685\n\nInput\n101 154 2\n\nOutput\n2189\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\\frac{50 \\cdot 51}{2} - \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.\n\nFor the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\\frac{2345 \\cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.\n\nFor the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is an integer that iterates from 2 to `n-1` in each iteration of the loop. If `num` is a prime number, `count` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than 3, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.
    return count
    #State of the program after the return statement: `count` is the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is an integer that iterates from 2 to `n-1` in each iteration of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts an integer parameter n, iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1, counts the prime numbers in that range, and returns the count of prime numbers found. If n is less than 3, the function returns 0 as there are no prime numbers between 2 and n.

#Function 2:
def is_prime(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #State of the program after the return statement: No variables are affected. The function simply returns False.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *l, r, and k are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and 1 <= k <= 10. If num is less than 2, the function returns False.
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2. If `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and int(num
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 2. If `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and int(num), the function returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `is_prime` accepts an integer `num` and checks if `num` is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, it iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `num` and if `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any number in the range, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
