Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(matrix)` that correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The code iterates through the matrix elements and adds the diagonal and anti-diagonal values to the total sum, ensuring that no element is added twice. The annotations provide a clear description of what the function does and how it handles cases where the input matrix is empty (n=0). The code aligns with the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality.
