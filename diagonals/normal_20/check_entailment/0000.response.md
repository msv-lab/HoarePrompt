Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by adding elements at positions (i, i) and (i, n - i - 1) for each row. However, the code is adding the elements twice for each row, which violates the requirement that no element of the matrix can be added twice. This means that the code is incorrect as it does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem description.
