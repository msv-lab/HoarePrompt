Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions do not directly address the problem description of calculating the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The functions are related to checking prime numbers and do not perform the required task. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
