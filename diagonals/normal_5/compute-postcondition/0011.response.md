According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration. 
State: **Total is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
