Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at the opposite end of the row to the current value of `total`. The value of `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. The state of the matrix is unknown. After executing the code, the value of `total` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
