According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total` is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
