Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is assumed to be a square matrix where each element is an integer. It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements and the elements at the opposite end of the row for each row in the matrix. The function then returns the total sum. However, the annotation assumes that the matrix is always square and each element is an integer, but the code does not enforce these conditions. Additionally, the code may not handle cases where the matrix is not square or elements are not integers. Further validation for these edge cases would be needed to ensure accurate functionality. **
