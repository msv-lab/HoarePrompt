Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. This means we are adding the element at the opposite end of the row to the current `total`. Since the initial state is `total` is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, after running the code, `total` will be updated with the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
