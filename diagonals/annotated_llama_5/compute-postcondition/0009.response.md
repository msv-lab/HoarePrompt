The code `total += matrix[i][i]` adds the value of the element at position `[i][i]` in the `matrix` to the `total`. Since `i` is 2, this means the value of the element at position `[2][2]` is added to the `total`. The value of `matrix` and `n` are not changed, only the value of `total` is updated.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, second diagonal, the element at position `[1][n - 2]`, and the element at position `[2][2]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 2**
