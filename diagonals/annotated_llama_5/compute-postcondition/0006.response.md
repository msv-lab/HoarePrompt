`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][i]` refers to the second element on the diagonal of the matrix. The previous value of `total` is the sum of the top left and top right elements of `matrix`. Therefore, the new value of `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, and second diagonal elements of `matrix`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, and second diagonal elements of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
