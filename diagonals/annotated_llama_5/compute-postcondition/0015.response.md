After analyzing the annotated code and return postconditions, I can provide a concise summary of the function's functionality.

The function `func_1` accepts a square matrix of integers as input. The code calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop does not execute, and the function returns 0. For non-empty matrices, the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.

However, I noticed that the annotations do not explicitly mention the case where the input matrix is not square. Although the code assumes that the input matrix is square, it does not perform any checks to ensure this. Therefore, if a non-square matrix is passed as input, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.

Considering all potential cases, including the edge case where the input matrix is empty or non-square, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal. If the input matrix is empty, it returns 0. However, if the input matrix is not square, the function's behavior is undefined and may produce incorrect results or raise an exception. **
