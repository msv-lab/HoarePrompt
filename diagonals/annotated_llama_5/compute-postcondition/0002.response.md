To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions that allow it to run. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `matrix` is described as a square list of lists of integers, and `n` represents both the number of rows and columns, `n` being greater than 0 implies that `matrix` is not empty and has at least one row and one column.

Given that `total` is 0 and does not directly affect the loop's execution, its state remains unchanged. However, we need to introduce `i`, which is the loop variable, and it starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
