The code adds the value of the element at position `(i, n - i - 1)` in the `matrix` to the `total`. 

Since `i` is 0, the element being added is at position `(0, n - 1)`, which is the top right element of the `matrix`. 

The value of `total` is initially the top left element of the `matrix`, and it is being increased by the top right element of the `matrix`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the top left and top right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the top left and top right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 0**
