Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, but it does not specify what should happen if the input matrix is not square. However, the annotations mention that if the input matrix is not square, the function's behavior is undefined and may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.

This means that the code does not handle the case where the input matrix is not square, which is a potential case that the problem description does not explicitly exclude. In other words, the code assumes that the input matrix is always square, but the problem description does not guarantee this.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by pointing out the potential issue with non-square input matrices. The annotations explicitly state that the function's behavior is undefined for non-square matrices, which suggests that the code does not handle this case correctly.

To fix this issue, the code should add a check to ensure that the input matrix is square before attempting to calculate the sum of the diagonals. If the matrix is not square, the code should raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input is invalid.

For example, the code could add a check at the beginning of the function like this:
```
def func_1(matrix):
    if len(matrix)!= len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("Input matrix is not square")
   ...
```
This would ensure that the code handles the case where the input matrix is not square and provides a clear error message to the user.
