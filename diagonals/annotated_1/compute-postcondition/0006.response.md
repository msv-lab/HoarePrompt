Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at the ith row and ith column of the `matrix` to it. The value of `i` is 1, and the dimensions of the `matrix` are n x n. Therefore, the element at the 1st row and 1st column of the `matrix` is added to `total`. 
Output State: **`total` is updated, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
