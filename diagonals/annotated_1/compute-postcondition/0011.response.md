According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to be greater than or equal to `i+1`.
State: **`total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+2`**
