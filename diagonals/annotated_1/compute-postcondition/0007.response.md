Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `n - i - 1` will be `n - 1`. If `n` is the dimension of the square matrix, then `matrix[1][n - 1]` corresponds to the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix. After the addition, the new value of `total` will be the sum of the previous `total` and the value of the selected element `matrix[1][n - 1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix**
