The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The precondition is that `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function calculates the final value of `total` based on the square matrix and the value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n and return the final value of `total` after the loop execution based on the matrix and the value of `n`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, calculates the final value of `total` based on the matrix and the value of `n`, and returns the final value of `total`.**
