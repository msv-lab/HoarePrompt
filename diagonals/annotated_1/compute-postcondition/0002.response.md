According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `total` being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`total` is 0, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
