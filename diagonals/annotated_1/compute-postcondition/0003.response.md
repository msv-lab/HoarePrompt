Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the value at the index `[i][i]` of the `matrix`. Since `i` is 0, the value at index `[0][0]` is added to `total`. The output state is: `total` is updated, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
