The function func_1 accepts a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, calculates the sum of the diagonal elements and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, and returns the total sum. If n is 0, the function returns 0. The function iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix to compute the total sum.
