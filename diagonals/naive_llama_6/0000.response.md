Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(matrix)` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. Here's why:

1. The function first determines the size of the matrix `n` by getting the length of the matrix.
2. It then initializes a variable `total` to store the sum of the diagonal elements.
3. The function uses a single loop to iterate over the rows of the matrix. In each iteration, it adds the element at the current position `i` on the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the element at the corresponding position on the secondary diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the `total`.
4. After the loop completes, the function returns the `total`, which is the sum of all elements along both diagonals.

This approach is correct because it covers all elements on both diagonals without adding any element twice. The use of a single loop and the clever indexing (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) ensure that the function is efficient and accurate.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles square matrices of any dimension `n√ón` correctly, and the calculation is performed without adding any element twice. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
