Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is 1. The previous state indicates that `total` is already updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]`. Therefore, after execution, `total` will be updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`. The state of `i` remains 1, and `n` remains greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
