Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is 2. The previous values of `total`, `i`, and `n` are known. Since `i` is 2, the code will add `matrix[2][2]` to the current value of `total`. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[1][n-2]`, `matrix[2][2]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[1][n-2]`, `matrix[2][2]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0**
