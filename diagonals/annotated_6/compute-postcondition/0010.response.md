Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. This results in the addition of `matrix[2][n - 3]` to `total`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[1][n-2]`, `matrix[2][2]`, `matrix[2][n-3]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0**
