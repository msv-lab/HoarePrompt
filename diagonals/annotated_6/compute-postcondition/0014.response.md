The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. If n is greater than 0, the function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements in the matrix and returns the total sum. If n is 0 or negative, the total sum remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square 2D list of integers `matrix` with dimensions n x n, and return the sum of diagonal elements if n is greater than 0. If n is 0 or negative, the function returns 0.
