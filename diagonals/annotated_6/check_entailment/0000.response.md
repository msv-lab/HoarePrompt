Correctness: False

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The program does not handle the requirement that no element of the matrix can be added twice when calculating the sum of both diagonals. The code simply adds the elements from the main diagonal and the opposite diagonal without checking for duplicates. This means that if there are duplicate elements in the diagonals, they will be counted multiple times, which goes against the problem description.
