According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated according to the new value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
