Example Answer:
The value at position `[i][i]` in the `matrix` is added to the `total`. The value of `i` is 1, so the value at position `[1][1]` in the `matrix` is added to `total`. The value of `n` is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated according to the new value at position `[1][1]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position `[1][1]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
