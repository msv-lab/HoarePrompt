Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at position `[i][i]` in the `matrix` to it. The value of `i` is 0, so the value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix` is added to `total`. The value of `n` being greater than 0 implies that the `matrix` has at least one row and column. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated according to the value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
