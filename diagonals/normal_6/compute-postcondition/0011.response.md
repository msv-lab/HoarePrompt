According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the increment and `n` remains the same.
State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix, `i` is (previous i value + 1), `n` remains the same**
