Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1(matrix)` calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, which is what the problem description asks for.

However, I do notice that the code does not handle the case where the input matrix is not square. The problem description does not explicitly state what should happen in this case, but it's possible that the function should raise an error or return a special value.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function will raise an IndexError if the input matrix is not square. This is consistent with the code, which does not include any checks for the matrix being square.

One potential edge case that the code might not be handling is when the matrix is empty (i.e., has a size of 0x0). In this case, the function will return 0, which is consistent with the problem description.

Another potential edge case is when the matrix has a size of 1x1. In this case, the function will return the single element of the matrix, which is consistent with the problem description.

Overall, based on the code and the output hints, I believe that the code is correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, and handles the edge cases of an empty matrix and a 1x1 matrix correctly. The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function will raise an IndexError if the input matrix is not square, which is consistent with the code.
