The code adds the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to `total`. Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is equivalent to `matrix[1][n - 2]`. The value of `matrix[1][n - 2]` is unknown, but it is an integer.

The state of `matrix` and `n` is not changed. The state of `i` is not changed. The state of `total` is changed by adding the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, second diagonal elements, and the third diagonal element of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
