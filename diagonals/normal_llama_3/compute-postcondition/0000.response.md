To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.

Given Code:
```python
n = len(matrix)
```

Now, let's analyze the code:

- The `len()` function in Python returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a list, it returns the number of items in the list.
- Since `matrix` is a 2D list (a list of lists), `len(matrix)` will return the number of sublists (i.e., the number of rows) in `matrix`.
- The variable `n` is assigned the value returned by `len(matrix)`.
- Since `matrix` is a square list of lists (i.e., the number of rows is equal to the number of columns), the value of `n` will be equal to the number of rows and the number of columns in `matrix`.

Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`.**
