The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, i.e., a 2D list where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. After executing the function body, if `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `matrix` remains unchanged, and the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of a square matrix; if `n` is 0, `i` is 0, `matrix` remains unchanged, and the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix of integers and return the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix size is greater than 0, otherwise return 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of integers, returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix size is greater than 0, otherwise return 0.**
