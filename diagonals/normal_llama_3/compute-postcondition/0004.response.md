The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Since `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `total` is updated by adding the value of the top-right element of `matrix`. The initial value of `total` is the top-left element of `matrix`, so the new value of `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 0**
