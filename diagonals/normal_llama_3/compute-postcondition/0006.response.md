The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `matrix[i][i]` is the second element of the second row of `matrix` (since indexing starts at 0). The value of `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`. The values of `matrix` and `n` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, and second diagonal elements of `matrix`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, and second diagonal elements of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
