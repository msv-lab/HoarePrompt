Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts a square matrix of integers as input. The code calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The code initializes a variable `n` to the length of the input matrix, which represents the number of rows (and columns) in the matrix.
2. It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.
3. The code then iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop. In each iteration, it adds the element at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) to the `total`. This corresponds to the main diagonal of the matrix.
4. Additionally, it adds the element at the current row and the column index mirrored across the center of the matrix (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the `total`. This corresponds to the anti-diagonal of the matrix.
5. After the loop completes, the code returns the `total`, which represents the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.

Considering all potential cases, I have identified the following edge cases and missing logic:

* If the input matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0. This is correctly handled by the code.
* If the input matrix is not square (i.e., the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns), the code will raise an IndexError when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. This is not handled by the code, and it is not clear what the expected behavior should be in this case.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square matrix of integers, returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix size is greater than 0, otherwise returns 0. However, if the input matrix is not square, the function will raise an IndexError. **
