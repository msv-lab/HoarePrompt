To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented, and `n` should still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `i` should be incremented to 1.
* `n` should be greater than 1.

The other states, `matrix` and `total`, are not affected by the loop condition, so they remain the same.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
