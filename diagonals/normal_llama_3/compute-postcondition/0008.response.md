To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `i` should be incremented to 2
* `n` should be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2)

The other states, `matrix` and `total`, are not affected by the loop statement and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, second diagonal elements, and the third diagonal element of `matrix`, `i` is 2**
