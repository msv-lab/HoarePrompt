To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be met before the loop starts. 

According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Before the loop starts, `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, and `total` is 0. However, the value of `total` does not affect the loop's execution. The shape and contents of `matrix` also do not directly impact the loop's execution, as long as `n` is correctly set to the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`.

Since `i` is the loop variable, it will be assigned a value from the range defined by `n` at the start of the loop. Therefore, we need to set `i` to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
