Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers. Since the matrix is square, its dimensions are n x n. Therefore, the value of `n` is the side length of the square matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the side length of the square matrix**
