According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `total` is updated with the new total value, and `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `total` is updated with the new total value, `i` is less than `n+1`**
