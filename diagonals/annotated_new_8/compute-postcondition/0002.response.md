According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. The `total` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is a non-negative integer and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
