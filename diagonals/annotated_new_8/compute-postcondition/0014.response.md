The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The **precondition** specifies that `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if n is 0, the function returns `total` as 0. If n is greater than 0, `total` contains the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square 2D list of integers `matrix` with dimensions n x n, and return the sum of the diagonal elements if n is greater than 0, otherwise return 0. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers matrix with dimensions n x n. If n is greater than 0, it returns the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is 0, it returns 0.**
