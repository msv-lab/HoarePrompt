Example Answer:
If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix and updates the `total` accordingly. After the loop executes, `total` will contain the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **If `n` is 0, `total` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, `total` contains the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix.**
