The value of `n` is assigned the length of `matrix`. Since `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, the length of `matrix` will be equal to `n`, which indicates the number of rows (or columns, since it is square). Therefore, the value of `n` will be a positive integer that represents the dimension of the matrix. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, `n` is the positive integer value equal to the length of `matrix`.**
