The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n√ón, where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of 'total', which is equal to the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the square matrix 'matrix'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix and return the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of that matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix and returns the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of that matrix.**
