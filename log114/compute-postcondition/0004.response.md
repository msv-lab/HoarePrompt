To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0]`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0

The code snippet modifies the `total` variable:
```
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

### Step-by-step Impact:
1. **Index Calculation**:
   - The expression `n - i - 1` is evaluated. Since `i` is `0`, this simplifies to `n - 1`.
   
2. **Matrix Access**:
   - The code accesses the element of `matrix` at the position `[i][n - i - 1]`, which translates to `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

3. **Total Update**:
   - The `total` variable is updated by adding `matrix[0][n - 1]` to its current value (`matrix[0][0]`).
   - Therefore, the new value of `total` becomes:
     ```
     total = matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]
     ```

### Output State:
The only affected variable is `total`. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
