The loop calculates the sum of the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal elements of a square matrix of dimension n×n. The loop will execute exactly n times if `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total` will be equal to the sum of the main diagonal elements (from `matrix[0][0]` to `matrix[n-1][n-1]`) and the anti-diagonal elements (from `matrix[0][n-1]` to `matrix[n-1][0]`).

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`, `n` is a positive integer, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n.**
