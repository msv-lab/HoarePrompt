According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
