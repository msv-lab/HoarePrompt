In this case, `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][i]` to it. Given that `i` is currently 1, the value added to `total` will be `matrix[1][1]`. 

The initial state indicates that `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]` and since `n` must be greater than 1, both `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]` are defined. After executing the code, `total` will increase by `matrix[1][1]`.

Therefore, the output state incorporates the updated value of `total`:

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
