The function accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n√ón, where n is a positive integer. It calculates and returns the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. However, it does not account for cases where the matrix may not be square or where n is zero, which could lead to incorrect behavior. The function assumes that the input will always be a valid square matrix of positive dimension.
