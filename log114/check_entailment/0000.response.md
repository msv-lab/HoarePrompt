The provided program intends to calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. Let's analyze the code against the problem description.

1. **Diagonal Elements Access**:
   - The program correctly identifies the main diagonal elements using `matrix[i][i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For the anti-diagonal, it correctly accesses elements using `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

2. **Double Counting**:
   - The program does not account for the case where the matrix size is odd. In such cases, the middle element (which is part of both diagonals) gets counted twice.
   - For example, in the matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the element `5` (located at `matrix[1][1]`) will be added once for the main diagonal and once for the anti-diagonal.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the sum of the diagonal elements, but due to the double counting issue mentioned above, the returned value is incorrect for odd-dimensioned matrices.

Since the program does not correctly handle the case of odd-dimensional matrices, it does not satisfy the problem description completely.

Correctness: **False**
