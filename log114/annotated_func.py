#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is equal to the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`, `n` is a positive integer, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n.
    return total
    #The program returns the value of 'total', which is equal to the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the square matrix 'matrix' of dimension n×n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix of dimension n×n, where n is a positive integer. It calculates and returns the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. However, it does not account for cases where the matrix may not be square or where n is zero, which could lead to incorrect behavior. The function assumes that the input will always be a valid square matrix of positive dimension.
