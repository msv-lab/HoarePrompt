Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the addition of an undirected edge. Specifically, when adding an edge between vertices `u` and `v`, the program incorrectly appends `u` to `graph[v]`. This violates the definition of an undirected graph, where adding an edge `(u, v)` should only add `v` to `u`'s neighbors and vice versa.

For example, consider the following case:

```python
graph = {1: [], 2: []}
func_1(graph, 1, 2)
print(graph)  # Expected output: {1: [2], 2: [1]}
```

However, the current implementation will result in:

```python
graph = {1: [2], 2: [2]}
```

This is incorrect because `2` should also be added to `1`'s neighbors. The correct implementation should ensure both `u` and `v` are added to each other's neighbors list.
