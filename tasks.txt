def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer n
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns n. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of n.
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is equal to n+1
    return curr
    #The program returns the value of 'curr', which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. Otherwise, it does not alter n and returns the value of curr, which is always 0.
Case_1: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns n. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of n.

Case_2: The program returns the value of 'curr', which is 0
