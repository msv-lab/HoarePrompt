def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer 'n' that is less than or equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. n is larger than 1
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is a non-negative integer, prev is 0, curr is 0, i is n+1
    return curr
    #The program returns the value of variable 'curr'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it returns the value of the variable curr.
Case_1: The program returns the non-negative integer 'n' that is less than or equal to 1

Case_2: The program returns the value of variable 'curr'.
