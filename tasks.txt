#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `sessions`, which is a dictionary where keys are user IDs (integers) and values are session objects (dictionaries containing "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean)), and a parameter `user`, which is an integer representing a user ID. If `user` is not in `sessions`, it returns a message indicating the user ID is not found. If `user` is in `sessions` and `session['ref_count']` is 0, it returns a message indicating the reference count is 0. If `user` is in `sessions`, the session object corresponding to `user` has `session['ref_count']` equal to 0 and `session['closed']` is `True`. If `user` is in `sessions`, the `session['ref_count']` is decremented by 1 and is no longer equal to 1, and `session['closed']` is `False`.
Case_1: sessions, which is a dictionary where keys are user IDs (integers) and values are session objects, which are dictionaries containing "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean), and the user is an integer representing a user ID that is not present in the sessions dictionary

Case_2: `sessions` is a dictionary where keys are user IDs (integers) and values are session objects, which are dictionaries containing "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean); the user ID `user` is in the `sessions` dictionary; `session` is the session object corresponding to the user ID `user` in the `sessions` dictionary; the current value of `session['ref_count']` is 0

Case_3: `sessions` is a dictionary where keys are user IDs (integers) and values are session objects, which are dictionaries containing "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean); the user ID `user` is in the `sessions` dictionary; `session` is the session object corresponding to the user ID `user` in the `sessions` dictionary; `session['ref_count']` is equal to 0; `session['closed']` is `True`.

Case_4: `sessions` is a dictionary where keys are user IDs (integers) and values are session objects, which are dictionaries containing "ref_count" (an integer >= 0 and is now `session['ref_count'] - 1` and is not equal to 1) and "closed" (a boolean and is `False`); the user ID `user` is in the `sessions` dictionary; `session` is the session object corresponding to the user ID `user` in the `sessions` dictionary
