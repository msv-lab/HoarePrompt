    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`balances` is a list of two integers. If the amount is less than or equal to the balance of Account A (`A`), then the balance of Account A is decreased by the amount and the balance of Account B is increased by the amount. Otherwise, the balance of Account A is set to 0 and the balance of Account B is increased by the amount.

    #The program returns a dictionary 'balances' that contains at least the key-value pair 'A': A and 'B': B
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `balances` (a list of two integers) and a parameter `amount` (a non-negative integer). It returns a dictionary containing at least the key-value pairs 'A': balance of Account A and 'B': balance of Account B.
The program returns a dictionary 'balances' that contains at least the key-value pair 'A': A and 'B': B
