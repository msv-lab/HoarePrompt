def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
    #The program returns `bonus_per_moved` which is calculated as `20 * min(total_A, total_B) / abs(total_A - total_B)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: `students_A`, `admins_A`, `students_B`, `admins_B`, and `profs_B`, which are lists of non-negative integers representing the number of first-semester students, administrators, and professors per class at Buildings A and B respectively. The function calculates `total_A` as the sum of elements in `students_A` and `admins_A`, and `total_B` as the sum of elements in `students_B`, `admins_B`, and `profs_B`. It then computes and returns `bonus_per_moved` using the formula `20 * min(total_A, total_B) / abs(total_A - total_B)`
The program returns `bonus_per_moved` which is calculated as `20 * min(total_A, total_B) / abs(total_A - total_B)`
