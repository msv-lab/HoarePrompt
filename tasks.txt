    #The program returns the total count of 'complete' tasks as 'completed' and the total count of 'pending' tasks as 'pending'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of strings `tasks` and a boolean `running`, returning the count of 'complete' tasks as 'completed' and the count of 'pending' tasks as 'pending'.
The program returns the total count of 'complete' tasks as 'completed' and the total count of 'pending' tasks as 'pending'
