    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: If numbers contain at least one number greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will be the count of such numbers, `num` will remain the first number in the list, and the `average` is the result of `total` divided by `count`. If all numbers are less than or equal to 1 or the list is empty, `total` will be 0, `count` will be 0, `num` will remain the first number in the list, and the `average` is undefined.

If all numbers are less than or equal to 1 or the list is empty, `total` will be 0, `count` will be 0, `num` will remain the first number in the list, and the `average` is undefined. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, `average` becomes `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of integers. If the list contains at least one number greater than 1, it calculates and returns the total, count, num, and average based on the specified conditions. If all numbers are less than or equal to 1 or the list is empty, it returns specific values, and in case of a ZeroDivisionError, it returns None for the average.
If numbers contain at least one number greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will be the count of such numbers, `num` will remain the first number in the list, and the `average` is the result of `total` divided by `count`. If all numbers are less than or equal to 1 or the list is empty, `total` will be 0, `count` will be 0, `num` will remain the first number in the list, and the `average` is undefined. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, `average` becomes `None`.
