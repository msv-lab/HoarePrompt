    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix by accessing elements at positions (i, i) and (i, n - i - 1) for each row. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute for n times, updating the total with the sum of diagonal elements. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the total will remain 0.
    return total
    #State of the program after the return statement: The total sum of diagonal elements calculated in the loop is returned
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a square matrix `matrix` and returns the total sum of diagonal elements calculated in the loop.
The total sum of diagonal elements calculated in the loop is returned
