#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts a list of integers, returns the maximum value found in the list, along with an iterator object for the list, the last element in the list, and indicates that the loop has terminated due to a StopIteration exception.
def func(numbers):
    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, max_value is 0
    max_value = 0
    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, max_value is 0, iterator is an iterator object for numbers
    iterator = iter(numbers)
    #This is a summary of the total loop and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, max_value is the maximum value found in the list, iterator is an iterator object for numbers, num is the last element in the list, and the loop has terminated due to a StopIteration exception.
    while True:
        try:
            num = next(iterator)
            if num > max_value:

                # In the following comments we are unrolling the loop 3 times to help you understand its functionality
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_1 and its total postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, max_value is the maximum value found in the list, iterator is an iterator object for numbers, num is the first integer value from the list. If there are no more elements in the iterator, the program encounters a StopIteration exception.
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_2 and its total postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers (with at least one more element), max_value is the maximum value found in the list, iterator is an iterator object for numbers. If num is greater than the current max_value, then max_value is updated to num. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the loop breaks.
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_3 and its total postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers (with at least one more element), max_value is the maximum value found in the list, iterator is an iterator object for numbers (has not reached the end of the list), and num is the next element in the list.
    #This is return statement and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, max_value is the maximum value found in the list, iterator is an iterator object for numbers, num is the last element in the list, and the loop has terminated due to a StopIteration exception. The function returns the max_value.
    return max_value
Return: numbers is a list of integers, max_value is the maximum value found in the list, iterator is an iterator object for numbers, num is the last element in the list, and the loop has terminated due to a StopIteration exception. The function returns the max_value.
