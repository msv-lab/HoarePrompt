#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and calculates the average based on the values of `total` and `count`. If `count` is 0, the average is set to None.
The `average` is calculated based on the values of `total` and `count`, unless `count` is 0, then `average` is set to None.
