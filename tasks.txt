    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least one row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
    return total
    #The program returns the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix multiplied by the number of times the loop executed.
The program returns the sum of the diagonal elements of the `matrix` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
