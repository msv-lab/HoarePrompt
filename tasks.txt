    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers with length greater than or equal to 2, `temp` is equal to `arr[0]`, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the array starting from the first element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[0])`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[0])`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the array starting from the first element, or the absolute difference between the last element and the first element if it is smaller.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr`. It returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the array starting from the first element, or the absolute difference between the last element and the first element if it is smaller. In certain conditions, the function returns `None`.
Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the array starting from the first element, or the absolute difference between the last element and the first element if it is smaller.
