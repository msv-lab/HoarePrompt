#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It updates `max_value` to the maximum value in the list, creates an iterator object from `numbers`, and assigns the next integer value from the list to `num`. If `num` is greater than the current `max_value`, it updates `max_value`. If a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the function breaks the loop and returns the final `max_value` after iterating through all numbers in the list.
