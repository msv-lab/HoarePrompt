    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop executes, if `numbers` list is not empty, then `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, then `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0.
    if (count == 0) :
        return None

    else :
        average = total / count
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *After the execution of the if-else block, if `numbers` list is not empty and contains elements greater than 1, then `average` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 divided by the count of such elements, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, then `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `numbers` is initially empty, `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `count` is 0, the program returns None.
    return average
    #The program returns the average of all elements in 'numbers' that are greater than 1, or 0 if 'numbers' is empty or all elements are less than or equal to 1. If 'count' is 0, the program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. After the execution of the if-else block, if the `numbers` list is not empty and contains elements greater than 1, then `average` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 divided by the count of such elements, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, then `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `numbers` is initially empty, `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `count` is 0, the program returns None.
#
#In Case 2, the program returns the average of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, or 0 if `numbers` is empty or all elements are less than or equal to 1. If `count` is 0, the program returns None.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the average, total, and count of elements greater than 1 in the list, and return them accordingly. If the list is empty, or all elements are less than or equal to 1, it returns 0. If there are no elements greater than 1, it returns None.
Case_1: *After the execution of the if-else block, if `numbers` list is not empty and contains elements greater than 1, then `average` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 divided by the count of such elements, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, then `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `numbers` is initially empty, `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `count` is 0, the program returns None.

Case_2: The program returns the average of all elements in 'numbers' that are greater than 1, or 0 if 'numbers' is empty or all elements are less than or equal to 1. If 'count' is 0, the program returns None.
