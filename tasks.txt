def func_1(my_list):
    if (len(my_list) % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers that may contain zero and non-zero values, and the length of `my_list` is odd.
    if (len(my_list) >= 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers that may contain zero and non-zero values, the length of `my_list` is odd, and the length of `my_list` is less than 3.
    return my_list[1]
    #The program returns the integer value at index 1 of the list 'my_list', which has an odd length less than 3. Therefore, 'my_list' contains exactly 1 element, and index 1 is out of range.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter my_list, which is a list of integers, and returns 0 in certain cases and attempts to return an out-of-range index value if the list has an odd length less than 3.
Case_1: The program returns the integer 0

Case_2: The program returns 0

Case_3: The program returns the integer value at index 1 of the list 'my_list', which has an odd length less than 3. Therefore, 'my_list' contains exactly 1 element, and index 1 is out of range.
