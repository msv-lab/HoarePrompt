def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer n
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the program returns n. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to the negative value of `n`, `prev` and `curr` hold values dependent on the initial value of `n`
    return curr
    #The program returns the value stored in 'curr'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it returns the value stored in 'curr'.
Case_1: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the program returns n. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.

Case_2: The program returns the value stored in 'curr'
