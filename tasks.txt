    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input is a list of integers that may contain both zero and non-zero values. If `x` is a positive integer, `x` is increased by 1. If `x` is less than 0, `x` is decremented by 1, resulting in a value less than 0. If `x` is 0, then it remains 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the value of `x`, which could be the result of incrementing it by 1 if it was positive, decrementing it by 1 if it was negative, or remaining 0 if it was zero.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers and returns each integer incremented by 1 if positive, decremented by 1 if negative, or unchanged if zero.
The program returns the value of `x`, which could be the result of incrementing it by 1 if it was positive, decrementing it by 1 if it was negative, or remaining 0 if it was zero.
