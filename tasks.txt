    #State: *`xs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `min_ending_here` is the minimum value among the last element of `xs`, `max_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, and `min_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, `max_ending_here` is the maximum value among the last element of `xs`, `max_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, and `min_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, `num` is the last element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.

    #The program returns the value of `best_so_far`, which is the maximum value among the last element of `xs`, `max_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, and `min_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, if this maximum value is greater than the previous `best_so_far`. Otherwise, it returns the previous `best_so_far`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `xs`. If the list is empty or contains only non-positive numbers, it returns negative infinity. Otherwise, it returns the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within the list.
Case_1: The program returns negative infinity as a floating-point number.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `best_so_far`, which is the maximum value among the last element of `xs`, `max_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, and `min_ending_here * last_element_of_xs`, if this maximum value is greater than the previous `best_so_far`. Otherwise, it returns the previous `best_so_far`.
