def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 0, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b + 1
                
            #State: `a` is the value of `b` from the previous iteration, `b` is the sum of the previous `a`, `b`, and 1, `_` is `n + 1`.
            return b
            #The program returns `b`, which is the sum of the previous `a`, `b`, and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. It returns 0 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and returns `b`, which is the sum of the previous `a`, `b`, and 1, for other values of `n`.
Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns 1

Case_3: The program returns `b`, which is the sum of the previous `a`, `b`, and 1.
