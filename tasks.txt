#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function `func` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns:
- `total`: the sum of all integers greater than 1 in the list.
- `count`: the number of integers greater than 1 in the list.
- `iterator`: at a valid position within `numbers`.
- `num`: the next integer after the last processed one.
- `average`: the division of `total` by `count` if `count` is not 0, otherwise `average` is `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the total sum and count of integers greater than 1, determine the next integer after the last processed one, and calculate the average of the integers greater than 1 in the list.

    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, total is 0

    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, total is 0, count is 0, iterator is the iterator of numbers
    iterator = iter(numbers)
    #This is a summary of the total loop and its postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, total is the sum of all integers greater than 1 in the list, count is the number of integers greater than 1 in the list, iterator is at a valid position within numbers, and num is the next integer after the last processed one. If a StopIteration exception occurs, no variables are affected as the break statement is used to exit the loop.
    while True:
        try:
            num = next(iterator)
            if num > 1:
                total += num
                count += 1

        # In the following comments we are unrolling the loop 3 times to help you understand its functionality
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_1 and its total postcondition is : numbers is a list of integers, total is the sum of all integers greater than 1 in the list, count is the number of integers greater than 1 in the list, iterator is at a valid position within numbers, and num is the next integer after the last processed one. If a StopIteration exception occurs, no variables are affected as the break statement is used to exit the loop.

If num is greater than 1, total is increased by num and count is increased by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If a StopIteration exception occurs, the loop breaks.
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_3 and its total postcondition is : `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is the sum of all integers greater than 1 in the list, `count` is the number of integers greater than 1 in the list, `iterator` is at a valid position within `numbers`, and `num` is the next integer after the last processed one. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is not greater than 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.
