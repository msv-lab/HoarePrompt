According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to n+1 after incrementing by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` equals n+1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` equals n+1**
