Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is less than or equal to n+1, it will still satisfy the condition after the increment. The values of `n`, `prev`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to n+1 after incrementing by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to n+1 after incrementing by 1**
