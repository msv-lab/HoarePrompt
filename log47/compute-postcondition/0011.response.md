Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`. Since the initial states of `prev` and `curr` are both 0, after execution, `prev` remains 0 and `curr` becomes 0 * 0, which is still 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to n+1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to n+1**
