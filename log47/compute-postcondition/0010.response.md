According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to n+1**
