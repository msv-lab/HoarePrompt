The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `n`.

Additionally, the function returns the value of `curr`, which is always 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `n` if it is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function does not alter `n` and returns the value of `curr`, which is always 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. Otherwise, it does not alter n and returns the value of curr, which is always 0.**
