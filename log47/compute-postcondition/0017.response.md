Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. Otherwise, it initializes prev and curr to 0 and 1 respectively, then enters a loop that iterates n+1 times updating prev and curr, but the multiplication logic seems incorrect. Finally, it returns the value of curr, which will always be 0. The function does not accurately calculate the Fibonacci sequence as intended due to the incorrect multiplication logic inside the loop.**
