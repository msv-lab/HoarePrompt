Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr` which is 0, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr` which is 0 * 0 = 0. Therefore, after execution, `prev` is 0 and `curr` is 0. The value of `i` remains 2. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2**
