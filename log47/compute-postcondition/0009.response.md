Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 2. After execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 3**
