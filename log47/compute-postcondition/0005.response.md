Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n as a parameter and recursively calculates the sum of the results of calling func_1 with arguments n-1 and n-2. The function returns the result of this summation.** 
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where n is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- The annotations suggest that the function should return n if n is less than or equal to 1, but the actual code returns n itself in this case, which might not be the intended behavior based on the annotation.
