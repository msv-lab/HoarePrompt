Example Answer:
The values of `prev` and `curr` are swapped, where `prev` takes the value of `curr` and `curr` takes the value of `prev` multiplied by `curr`. Since `prev` was 1 and `curr` was 0, after execution, `prev` becomes 0 and `curr` becomes 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
