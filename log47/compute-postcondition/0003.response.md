Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value 0 and `curr` is assigned the value 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged since the code snippet does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1**
