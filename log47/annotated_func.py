#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer n
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns n. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of n.
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is equal to n+1
    return curr
    #The program returns the value of 'curr', which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. Otherwise, it initializes prev and curr to 0 and 1 respectively, then enters a loop that iterates n+1 times updating prev and curr, but the multiplication logic seems incorrect. Finally, it returns the value of curr, which will always be 0. The function does not accurately calculate the Fibonacci sequence as intended due to the incorrect multiplication logic inside the loop.
