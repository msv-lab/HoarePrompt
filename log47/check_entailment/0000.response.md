Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly compute the n-th Fibonacci number as per the problem description. 

The issue lies in the while loop where the calculation of the next Fibonacci number is incorrect. The line `prev, curr = curr, prev * curr` should be `prev, curr = curr, prev + curr` in order to correctly compute the Fibonacci sequence.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
