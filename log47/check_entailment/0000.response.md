Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. It recursively calculates the sum of the results of calling the function with arguments n-1 and n-2, which aligns with the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. The base case is also handled correctly by returning n if n is less than or equal to 1. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
