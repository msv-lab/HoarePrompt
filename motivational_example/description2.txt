You have a list of 2D points in the plane, representing the vertices of a simple (non-self-intersecting) polygon. The vertices are listed **in order** (either clockwise or counterclockwise). You want to compute the **area** of this polygon using the famous “shoelace formula” (a.k.a. Gauss’s area formula).

- **Input**: A list of points \([(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})]\).
- **Output**: A single floating-point number representing the area of the polygon.

**Notes/Constraints**  
1. The polygon is guaranteed to be simple (no edges cross).  
2. The points are in a consistent order (all clockwise or all counterclockwise).  
3. There are at least 3 points.  
4. You do **not** need to handle degenerate polygons (where points are collinear).
