You have a sessions dictionary that maps user IDs to session objects, where each session object has two keys:

"ref_count" (an integer >= 0): The number of “open references” or “active connections” for this user’s session.
"closed" (a boolean): Indicates whether the session is closed (True) or open (False).

If ref_count is 0, the session is marked closed (closed = True).
If ref_count is greater than 0, the session is be marked open (closed = False).
We want a functionthta Checks if user is actually in sessions. If not, it does nothing ,Decrements the user’s ref_count by 1  if it’s above 0 and If the resulting ref_count is now 0, set closed = True. Otherwise, set closed = False.
