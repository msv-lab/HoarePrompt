Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly handles the transfer of funds between two accounts under the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic and edge cases:

1. **Sufficient Funds**: If the amount to be transferred (`amount`) is less than or equal to the current balance of Account A (`A`), the function deducts the full amount from Account A and adds it to Account B. This ensures that the transfer is fully completed.

2. **Insufficient Funds**: If the amount to be transferred exceeds the balance of Account A, the function sets the balance of Account A to zero and adds the remaining balance (which is zero) to Account B. This ensures that only the available funds are transferred.

Given these points, the function behaves as expected for all possible cases:
- If `amount` is within the balance of Account A, the function correctly transfers the full amount.
- If `amount` exceeds the balance of Account A, the function correctly transfers the available balance and leaves Account A with zero.

Since no edge cases or inputs have been identified that would cause the function to fail, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is True.
