`z` is assigned the value of `x + y`. Since `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than or equal to 0, `z` will be greater than `x` and less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers; `x` is greater than `y`; `y` is less than or equal to 0; `z` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `x`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers; `x` is greater than `y`; `y` is less than or equal to 0; `z` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `x`.**
