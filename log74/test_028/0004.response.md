The variable `y` is assigned the value `x - 5`. Given that `x` is an integer, greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10, the possible values for `x` are 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Therefore, the possible values for `y` will be:

- If `x` is 6, then `y` is 1.
- If `x` is 7, then `y` is 2.
- If `x` is 8, then `y` is 3.
- If `x` is 9, then `y` is 4.
- If `x` is 10, then `y` is 5.

Thus, the output state reflects the range of possible values for both `x` and `y`. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10; `y` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5**.
