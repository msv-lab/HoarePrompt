SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the state of the variables `x` and `y` after the execution of the function. In both cases, `x` is described as an integer that is either 0 or negative, which aligns with "x is an integer and less than or equal to 0". The expected postcondition states that `y` is `-x`, which implies `y` is a non-negative integer (since `x` is 0 or negative). The computed postcondition confirms that `y` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, semantically, both postconditions describe the same state of the program where `x` is non-positive and `y` is non-negative.
