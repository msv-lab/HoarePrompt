`y` is assigned the value `-x`. Since `x` is an integer and is less than or equal to 0, `-x` will be greater than or equal to 0. The output state reflects this change. Therefore, `x` is an integer and less than or equal to 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`x` is an integer and less than or equal to 0; `y` is greater than or equal to 0**
