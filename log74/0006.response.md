SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same range and relationship between `x` and `y`. The expected postcondition states that `x` is an integer between 6 and 10 inclusive, and `y` is `x - 5`. The computed postcondition also states that `x` is an integer between 6 and 10 inclusive (as it says `x` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10) and that `y` can be any of the values 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which directly corresponds to `y` being `x - 5` for each possible value of `x`. Thus, both postconditions describe the same logical program state.
