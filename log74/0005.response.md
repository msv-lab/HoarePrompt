SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition do not describe the same state semantically. While both postconditions agree on the conditions for when `x` is equal to `y` (i.e., `z` is set to the sum of `x` and `y`), they diverge when it comes to the case where `x < y`. In the expected postcondition, `z` is set to the difference between `y` and `x` when `x < y`. However, the computed postcondition introduces a third case where if `x > y`, the function returns a string 'X is greater', which is not mentioned in the expected postcondition. This additional scenario in the computed postcondition means the two are not semantically the same, as the expected postcondition provides no behavior or description for when `x > y`.
