`z` is assigned the value of `y - x`. Given that `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the result of `y - x` will be a non-negative integer. The value of `z` will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`, but it will always be greater than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, `z` is an integer and is equal to `y - x`.**
