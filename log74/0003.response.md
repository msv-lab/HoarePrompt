SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition do not semantically describe the same state. In the expected postcondition, it indicates that `z` is equal to `x + y`. However, in the computed postcondition, it states that `z` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `x`, which is a contradiction and does not logically align with the expected postcondition of `z = x + y`. Therefore, the states described in the postconditions are not equivalent.
