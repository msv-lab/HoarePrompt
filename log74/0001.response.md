SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state: that `x` is a positive integer and that `x` is odd. The expected postcondition combines these two characteristics into a single statement, while the computed postcondition explicitly lists them separately. Semantically, they both convey that `x` must be a positive integer and that it must be odd, thus aligning with each other in meaning.
