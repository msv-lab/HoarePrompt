The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns an integer value that is `x` plus 1. If `x` is less than 0, the function returns `x` minus 1, resulting in a value less than -1. If `x` is exactly 0, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return different values based on the value of `x`: `x + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, `x - 1` if `x` is less than 0, and `0` if `x` is equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns x + 1 if x is greater than 0, returns x - 1 if x is less than 0, and returns 0 if x is equal to 0.**
