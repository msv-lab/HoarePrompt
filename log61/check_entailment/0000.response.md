Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem statement. Instead, it defines a function `func_1` that performs arithmetic operations based on the value of the integer `x`. Specifically, it adds 1 to `x` if `x` is greater than 0, subtracts 1 from `x` if `x` is less than 0, and returns 0 if `x` is equal to 0. 

This behavior is unrelated to the computation of Fibonacci numbers, which are defined by the recurrence relation:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

Since the program does not implement this logic or return Fibonacci numbers, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
