The function `func_1` recursively calculates the sum of the results of `func_1(n - 1)` and `func_1(n - 2)` for a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the sum of the results of `func_1(n - 1)` and `func_1(n - 2)`. During execution, the statement 'n is greater than 1' is printed.
