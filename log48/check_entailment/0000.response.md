Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the n-th Fibonacci number recursively. It handles the base cases where n is less than or equal to 1, and for all other cases, it recursively calls the function with n-1 and n-2. The program returns the sum of the results from the recursive calls, which is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. The program seems to work as expected for all potential cases, and there are no apparent issues or edge cases where it would fail to produce the correct result.
