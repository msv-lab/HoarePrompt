Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n - 1)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1. The value of `n - 1` is passed as an argument to `func_1`. The value of `x` is 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `x` is 1, `temp` is the result of `func_1(n - 1)`.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `x` is 1, `temp` is the result of `func_1(n - 1)**
