The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`.

Case_2: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the result of `func_1(n - 1)` added to the result of `func_1(n - 2)`. During execution, the statement 'n is greater than 1' is printed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either `n` if it is less than or equal to 1, or the sum of the results of `func_1(n - 1)` and `func_1(n - 2)` if `n` is greater than 1.
