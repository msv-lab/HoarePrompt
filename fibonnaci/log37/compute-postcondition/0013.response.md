The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`.

Case_2: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the product of all numbers from 2 to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `n` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the product of all numbers from 2 to `n`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it returns the product of all numbers from 2 to n.**
