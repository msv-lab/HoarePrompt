Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the product of all numbers from 2 to n. However, the current implementation of the function does not correctly calculate the product of all numbers from 2 to n as intended. The functionality is limited to returning n if n is less than or equal to 1.**
