According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is updated, `curr` is updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 4.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 4, `prev` is updated, `curr` is updated**
