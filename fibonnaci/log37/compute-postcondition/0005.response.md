Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr` and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`. The initial values of `prev` and `curr` are unknown, but since `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is updated according to the previous values of `prev` and `curr`, and `curr` is updated according to the previous values of `prev` and `curr`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is updated, `curr` is updated**
