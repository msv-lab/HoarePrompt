SAME: True  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition describe the same logical state of the program after execution. Both state that `i` is equal to `n + 1` and that `prev` is 1 and `curr` is 1. The expected postcondition provides a conditional expression for when `n` is 0 or greater than 0, but the outcome (`prev` is 1 and `curr` is 1) is consistent in both cases. The computed postcondition encapsulates this by directly stating the values of `prev` and `curr` as 1, without explicitly distinguishing between the cases for `n`, which aligns with the expected postcondition's ultimate result. Additionally, the computed postcondition specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, which is a reasonable assumption based on the context and does not contradict the expected postcondition. Therefore, semantically, both postconditions describe the same program state.
