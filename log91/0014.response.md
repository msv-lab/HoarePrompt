SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition describe different logical states regarding the variables `prev` and `curr` after the loop. The expected postcondition states that if `n` is 0, then `prev` is 1 and `curr` is 1, and for `n > 0`, `prev` is either 1 or 0 and `curr` is either 0 or 1. However, the computed postcondition specifies a more deterministic behavior where `prev` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd, and `curr` is 1 if `n` is even and 0 if `n` is odd. These descriptions are not semantically the same because they predict different values for `prev` and `curr` based on the parity of `n`.
