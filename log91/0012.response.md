SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition do not semantically describe the same state.

The expected postcondition outlines a specific relationship between `x` and `y` based on the value of `x`:

1. If `x > 10`, then `y` should be 10 times `x`.
2. If `5 < x <= 10`, then `y` should be 20 times `x`.
3. If `0 < x <= 5`, then `y` should be 100 times `x`.
4. Otherwise, `y` can have any value.

The computed postcondition, however, provides specific possible values for `y` based on the ranges of `x`:

1. If `x > 10`, `y` is simply stated to be an integer greater than 100, but not necessarily 10 times `x`.
2. If `5 < x <= 10`, `y` can be one of several specific values (120, 140, 160, 180, 200), which corresponds to 20 times `x` for `x` values 6 through 10.
3. If `0 < x <= 5`, `y` can be one of several specific values (100, 200, 300, 400, 500), which corresponds to 100 times `x` for `x` values 1 through 5.
4. If `x <= 0`, no changes to `y` are specified, which does not align with the expected postcondition that `y` can have any value.

The mismatch arises from the computed postcondition being more specific in terms of possible exact values for `y` in the second and third conditions, and the lack of specification for `y` when `x` is less than or equal to 0. These differences in detail make the two postconditions semantically different.
