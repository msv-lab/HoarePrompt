According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first integer in the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`total` is `num`, for the loop to execute a second time `numbers` must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list**
