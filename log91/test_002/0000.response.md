According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `total` is 0, which does not impact the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the `numbers` list must contain at least one integer, and `num` will be the first integer in the list. 

State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first integer in the list**
