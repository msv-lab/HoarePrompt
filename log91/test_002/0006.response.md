The loop calculates the sum of all integers in the list `numbers` and stores it in `total`. The loop will execute for each integer in the list, and if the list is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `total` at its initial value of 0.

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in `numbers`, `num` is the last integer in the list if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `total` is 0.**
