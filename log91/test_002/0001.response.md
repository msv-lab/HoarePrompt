`total` is incremented by `num`, where `total` is initially 0 and `num` is the first integer in the list `numbers`. After execution, `total` will be equal to `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `num`, `num` is the first integer in the list `numbers`.

Output State: **`total` is `num`, `num` is the first integer in the list `numbers`**
