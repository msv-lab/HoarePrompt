`total` is assigned the value of `total + num`. Since `total` is `num`, this means `total` will now be `num + num`, which equals `2 * num`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `total` is `2 * num`, `num` is the second integer in the list.

Output State: **`total` is `2 * num`, `num` is the second integer in the list**
