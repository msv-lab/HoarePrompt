According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is `2 * num`, and `num` is the second integer in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the third integer in the list, and the loop will increment `num` to the next integer in the list.

State: **`total` is `2 * num`, `num` is the third integer in the list, for the loop to execute a third time `numbers` must have at least 3 integers.**
