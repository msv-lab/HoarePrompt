The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Since `total` is initially `2 * num`, after the execution, `total` becomes `2 * num + num`, which simplifies to `3 * num`. The state of the variable `num` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `3 * num`, `num` is the third integer in the list.

Output State: **`total` is `3 * num`, `num` is the third integer in the list**
