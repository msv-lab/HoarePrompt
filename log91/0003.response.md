REASON: Both postconditions describe the same final state of the program. They indicate that the list `numbers` is empty and that the variable `total` holds the sum of all integers that were originally in the `numbers` list. The semantic meaning is aligned, as both indicate that `numbers` has been processed to become empty and `total` accurately reflects the sum of its original elements.
