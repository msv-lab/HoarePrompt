SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition describes two conditional behaviors: if `x > 0`, then `y` is increased by `x`, and if `y < 0` after this modification, `z` is decreased by the new value of `y`. The computed postcondition, however, only addresses the situation when `y < 0` by stating that `z` is decreased by `y` without acknowledging any change to `y` that might have occurred due to `x > 0`. Additionally, the computed postcondition does not cover the possibility of `y` being increased by `x`, which is a crucial step in the expected postcondition. Thus, the semantic meanings of the two postconditions do not align.
