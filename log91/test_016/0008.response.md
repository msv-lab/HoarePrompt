The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown in the initial state provided. The states of the other variables `prev` and `curr` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 1, `curr` is 1; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1; variable `i` is increased by 1**
