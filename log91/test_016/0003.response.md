According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1 since `i` is currently 1. Thus, the condition `i <= n` can still be satisfied if `n` is equal to or greater than 1.

State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
