The values of `prev` and `curr` are updated simultaneously. `prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, which is currently 1. Then `curr` is updated to the value of `prev * curr`, which calculates as `1 * 1`, resulting in 1. The state of the variable `i` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
