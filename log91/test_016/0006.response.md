According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
