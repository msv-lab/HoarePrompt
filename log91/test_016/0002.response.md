The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer**
