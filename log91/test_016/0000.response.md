According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` can be any non-negative integer, and no adjustments are necessary for `i` to allow the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
