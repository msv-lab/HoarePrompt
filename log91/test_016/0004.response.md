The values of `prev` and `curr` are updated based on the assignment `prev, curr = curr, prev * curr`. Here, `prev` will take the value of `curr`, which is `1`, and `curr` will be assigned the value of `prev * curr`, which is `1 * 1 = 1`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, after execution, `prev` remains `1`, `curr` remains `1`, and `i` stays `1`.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1**
