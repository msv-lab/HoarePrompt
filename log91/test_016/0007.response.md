The values of `prev` and `curr` are updated according to the assignment. `prev` is assigned the current value of `curr`, which is 1, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`, which is 1 * 1 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 1, `curr` is 1.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1**
