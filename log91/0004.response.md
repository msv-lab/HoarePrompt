SAME: True  
REASON: Both the expected and computed postconditions describe the same state semantically. They both assert that `total` should be the sum of all integers present in `matrix`, and they both recognize that `matrix` is a 2D list of integers. The wording is slightly different, but the logical meaning and program behavior they describe are identical.
