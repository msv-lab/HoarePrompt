SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition states that `total` is the sum of all integers in the list `numbers` and doesn't mention what happens if the list is empty. The computed postcondition, however, provides additional information: if `numbers` is not empty, `total` is as expected, but if `numbers` is empty, `total` is 0. The computed postcondition also introduces a variable `num`, representing the last integer in the list, which the expected postcondition does not mention. Therefore, the computed postcondition describes a more specific and slightly different program state than the expected postcondition.
