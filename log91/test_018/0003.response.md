The program could raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file specified by `filename` does not exist. If the file is found, it opens the file in read mode and reads its content into the `content` variable. If the file is not found, the `except` block sets `content` to an empty string.

Therefore: Output State: **`filename` is a string representing a valid file path; if the file is found, `file` is an open file object in read mode and `content` is the string read from the file; if the file is not found, `content` is set to an empty string.**
