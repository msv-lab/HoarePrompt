Given the following two postconditions for a Python function:

1. Expected Postcondition: A description of the state of the program that should hold after executing the given code.
2. Computed Postcondition: A description of the state of the program generated by a tool based on the provided precondition and code.

Your task is to determine whether these two postconditions are semantically relatively the same, meaning they describe a very similar logical program state or behavior. You do not need to check for exact wording, but their semantic meaning must align.

For your response, provide:

- SAME: **True or False** (True if they describe the same state semantically; False if not).
- REASON: **The reason why the postconditions are the same or not**.

Here are the two postconditions:

Expected Postcondition:  
numbers is a list, index is an integer. If index is within the bounds of numbers, value is numbers[index]. If index is out of bounds of the list numbers, value is None.

Computed Postcondition:  
`numbers` is a list, `index` is an integer. If `index` is valid, `value` is the element at `numbers[index]`, otherwise `value` is None.

Your Response: 

SAME: **True or False**  
REASON: **Explanation for the decision**
