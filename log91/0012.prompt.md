Given the following two postconditions for a Python function:

1. Expected Postcondition: A description of the state of the program that should hold after executing the given code.
2. Computed Postcondition: A description of the state of the program generated by a tool based on the provided precondition and code.

Your task is to determine whether these two postconditions are semantically relatively the same, meaning they describe a very similar logical program state or behavior. You do not need to check for exact wording, but their semantic meaning must align.

For your response, provide:

- SAME: **True or False** (True if they describe the same state semantically; False if not).
- REASON: **The reason why the postconditions are the same or not**.

Here are the two postconditions:

Expected Postcondition:  
x is an integer.If x > 10, y is 10 times the value of x. If 5 < x <= 10, y is 20 times the value of x. If 0 < x <= 5, y is 100 times the value of x . Otherwise, y can have any value.

Computed Postcondition:  
*`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, then `y` is an integer greater than 100. If `x` is less than or equal to 10 and greater than 5, then `y` is either 120, 140, 160, 180, or 200. If `x` is less than or equal to 5 and greater than 0, then `y` is either 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, there are no changes to `y`.

Your Response: 

SAME: **True or False**  
REASON: **Explanation for the decision**
