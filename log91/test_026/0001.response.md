The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a.upper()`, which converts the string `a` to uppercase. Since `a` is a string with a length greater than 5, `b` will also be a string of uppercase characters but its exact content is not specified. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string with a length greater than 5; `b` is the uppercase version of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string with a length greater than 5; `b` is the uppercase version of `a`**
