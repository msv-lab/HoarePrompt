SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same semantic state regarding the variable `total`. They both state that `total` is the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1`. The computed postcondition provides additional information about the variable `i` and the special case when `n` is 0, but these details do not contradict or change the semantic meaning of the expected postcondition regarding `total`. Therefore, the core semantic meaning about `total` being the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1` is aligned in both postconditions.
