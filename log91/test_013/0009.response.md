Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer less than or equal to 10. If `x` is greater than 5, then `y` is either 120, 140, 160, 180, or 200. If `x` is less than or equal to 5 and greater than 0, then `y` is either 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, there are no changes to `y`.***
