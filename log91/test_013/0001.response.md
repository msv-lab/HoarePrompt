`y` is assigned the value of `x * 10`. Since `x` is an integer and greater than 10, `y` will take a value that is greater than 100. The value of `x` is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer and greater than 10; `y` is an integer and greater than 100.

Output State: **`x` is an integer and greater than 10; `y` is an integer and greater than 100**
