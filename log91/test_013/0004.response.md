`y` is assigned the value of `20 * x`. Given that `x` is an integer, less than or equal to 10, and greater than 5, the possible values of `x` are 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Thus, the possible values of `y` will be `20 * 6`, `20 * 7`, `20 * 8`, `20 * 9`, or `20 * 10`, which results in `120`, `140`, `160`, `180`, or `200`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `x` is either 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10; `y` is either 120, 140, 160, 180, or 200.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is either 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10; `y` is either 120, 140, 160, 180, or 200**
