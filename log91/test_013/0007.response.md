The variable `y` is assigned the value `100 * x`. Given the initial state, `x` is an integer that is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the possible values for `x` can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Consequently, the value of `y` will be 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 depending on the specific value of `x`. 

Since the exact value of `x` was not provided, we cannot determine a specific value for `y`. Thus, the output state reflects the possible values of `y` based on the range of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is less than or equal to 5, and `x` is greater than 0; `y` is either 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500**.
