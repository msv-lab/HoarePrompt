SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same final state of the program. They both specify that the variable `counter` is 0 and that `total` is the sum of integers from 1 to the initial value of `counter`. The difference in wording arises from the direction in which the summation is described (from the initial value to 1 vs. from 1 to the initial value), but mathematically, these represent the same sum. Therefore, semantically, the postconditions align.
