SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the state of the program in a semantically similar way. They both assert that `data` is a dictionary and `key` is a string. They also both claim that if `key` exists in `data`, then `value` will be the associated value from `data`, otherwise `value` will be 'Key not found'. The logical description of the program state is the same, even though the wording is slightly different.
