Given the following two postconditions for a Python function:

1. Expected Postcondition: A description of the state of the program that should hold after executing the given code.
2. Computed Postcondition: A description of the state of the program generated by a tool based on the provided precondition and code.

Your task is to determine whether these two postconditions are semantically relatively the same, meaning they describe a very similar logical program state or behavior. You do not need to check for exact wording, but their semantic meaning must align.

For your response, provide:

- SAME: **True or False** (True if they describe the same state semantically; False if not).
- REASON: **The reason why the postconditions are the same or not**.

Here are the two postconditions:

Expected Postcondition:  
a, b, and c are integers. If a > b and b > c, x is a - c. If a > b and c > a, x is c - b. If a > b and c <= a, x is a + b. If a <= b, x is b + c.

Computed Postcondition:  
*`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then if `b` is greater than `c`, `x` is equal to `a - c`. If `c` is greater than `a`, then `x` is a positive integer resulting from `c - b`. Otherwise, `x` is equal to `a + b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then `x` is equal to `b + c`.

Your Response: 

SAME: **True or False**  
REASON: **Explanation for the decision**
