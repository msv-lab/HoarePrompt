SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition differ in the case where `x > 0` and `y <= 0`. In the expected postcondition, `z` is calculated as `x - y`. However, the computed postcondition states that `z` is a positive integer greater than `x`, which implies a different mathematical operation or outcome than `x - y`. This discrepancy in behavior for the specific condition `x > 0` and `y <= 0` means that the two postconditions are not semantically the same.
