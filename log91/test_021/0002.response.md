The program could raise a `KeyError` if the specified `key` does not exist in the `data` dictionary. If the `key` exists, the function retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary and assigns it to `value`. If the `key` is not found, the `KeyError` is caught, and `value` is assigned the string 'Key not found'.

Therefore, the output state is: `data` is a dictionary, `key` is a string, and `value` is either the value associated with `key` in `data` or 'Key not found' if the key does not exist.

Output State: **`data` is a dictionary, `key` is a string, and `value` is either the value associated with `key` in `data` or 'Key not found' if the key does not exist.**
