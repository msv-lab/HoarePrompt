SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe a situation where `x` and `y` are integers, and `z` is calculated as `x + y`. The expected postcondition specifies that `x > y` and `y <= 0`, which implies that `z = x + y` will be less than `x` because `y` is non-positive. The computed postcondition states directly that `z < x`, which aligns with the implication of the expected postcondition that `y` being less than or equal to zero would make `z` less than `x`. Therefore, semantically, both postconditions describe the same logical state.
