SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition allows for 'y' to have any value if 'x' is not greater than 0, implying that 'y' could potentially be assigned any arbitrary value or be left unchanged. The computed postcondition, however, specifies that if 'x' is less than or equal to 0, 'y' remains unchanged, which is a more specific condition than allowing 'y' to take any value. This difference in the permissiveness regarding the value of 'y' when 'x' is not greater than 0 creates a semantic difference between the two postconditions.
