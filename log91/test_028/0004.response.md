`y` is assigned the value of `x - 5`. Given the initial state that `x` is an integer greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10, the possible values for `x` are 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Consequently, the corresponding values for `y` will be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 respectively. Therefore, the output state reflects the range of values for both `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10; `y` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5**
