`total` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `total` is 0 and `i` is 1, after execution, `total` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The conditions for the loop are not altered. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is 1, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
