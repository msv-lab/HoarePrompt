According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be 2.

State: **`total` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.**
