According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
