`total` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `total` is 1, and the value of `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `total` becomes 3. The state of `i` remains unchanged. Since the loop's execution conditions were not specified to change, we only focus on the values affected by the code. 

Output State: **`total` is 3, `i` is 2**
