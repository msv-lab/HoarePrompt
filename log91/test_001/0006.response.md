The loop calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to n-1 and stores it in total. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and total remains 0. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, and total will be the sum of the first n-1 integers, which is given by the formula (n-1)*n/2.

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers from 0 to n-1, `total` is 0 if `n` is 0, and `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0.**
