SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition specifies that if `x > 0` and `y < 0`, then `z` is specifically `x - y`. In contrast, the computed postcondition states that if `x > 0` and `y < 0`, then `z` is greater than `x`. These two conditions are not semantically equivalent because the computed postcondition allows `z` to be any value greater than `x`, which does not necessarily equal `x - y` as specified in the expected postcondition. Thus, they describe different states of the program.
