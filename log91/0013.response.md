SAME: **True**  
REASON: The two postconditions describe the same logical state of the program. Both specify the same conditions and the resulting value of `x` based on comparisons between the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here's the breakdown:

- Both postconditions start by stating that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
- For the case where `a > b`:
  - Both postconditions state that if `b > c`, then `x = a - c`.
  - Both postconditions state that if `c > a`, then `x = c - b`.
  - Both postconditions state that if `c <= a`, then `x = a + b`.
- For the case where `a <= b`:
  - Both postconditions state that `x = b + c`.

The conditions and resulting actions are described equivalently in both postconditions, showing that they semantically represent the same program state.
