To determine the output state, we note that `result` is assigned the value `100 / value`. The variable `value` is an integer converted from `input_string`, but the specific value of `input_string` is not provided. Therefore, the exact value of `result` cannot be calculated. However, we can state that `result` will be the result of the division of 100 by the integer value derived from `input_string`. Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`input_string` is a string; `value` is an integer converted from `input_string`; `result` is 100 divided by `value`.**
