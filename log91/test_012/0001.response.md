The value of `y` is incremented by `x`. Since `x` is greater than 0, the value of `y` will increase by that positive integer. The specific previous values of `y` and `z` are not provided, so we only know that `y` will be `y + x` and `z` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is greater than 0, `y` is increased by `x`, `z` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `y` is increased by `x`, `z` remains unchanged**
