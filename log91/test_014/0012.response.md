Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then if `b` is greater than `c`, `x` is equal to `a - c`. If `c` is greater than `a`, then `x` is a positive integer resulting from `c - b`. Otherwise, `x` is equal to `a + b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then `x` is equal to `b + c`.***
