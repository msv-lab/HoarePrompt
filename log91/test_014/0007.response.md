The variable `x` is assigned the value of `a + b`. Given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and the conditions specified (`a` is greater than `b`, `b` is less than or equal to `c`, and `c` is less than or equal to `a`), the value of `x` will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `x` is `a + b`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `x` is `a + b`**
