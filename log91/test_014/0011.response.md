In the provided code snippet, `x` is assigned the value of `b + c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, but `a` is known to be less than or equal to `b`. The value of `x` will depend on the specific values of `b` and `c`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` as well as the assignment of `x`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `a` is less than or equal to `b`; `x` is `b + c`**
