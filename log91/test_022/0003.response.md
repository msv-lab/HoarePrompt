`y` is assigned the value of `-x`. Since `x` is an integer and is less than or equal to 0, the value of `-x` will be either 0 or a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `y` will be non-negative. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer and `x` is less than or equal to 0; `y` is either 0 or a positive integer.**
