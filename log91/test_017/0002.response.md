The program could raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the `denominator` is 0 during the division operation `result = numerator / denominator`. If `denominator` is not zero, the function successfully computes the value of `result` as `numerator` divided by `denominator`. However, if `denominator` is zero, the exception is caught, and `result` is set to `None`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` and `denominator` are numeric values. If `denominator` is zero, `result` is None; otherwise, `result` is the value of `numerator / denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` are numeric values. If `denominator` is zero, `result` is None; otherwise, `result` is the value of `numerator / denominator.**
