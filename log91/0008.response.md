SAME: True  
REASON: Both the Expected Postcondition and the Computed Postcondition describe the same logical state of the program. In both cases, they agree that `x` is an integer and `y` is a string. They also specify the same conditions for the value of `y`: if `x` is greater than 0, `y` should be 'positive'; if `x` is equal to 0, `y` should be 'zero'; and if `x` is less than 0, `y` should be 'negative'. The wording might differ slightly, but the semantic meaning and logical conditions described are identical.
