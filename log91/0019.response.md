SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program. They both specify that `numbers` is a list and `index` is an integer. They also agree on the behavior of `value`: if `index` is within the bounds of the list `numbers`, `value` should be the element at `numbers[index]`; if `index` is out of bounds, `value` should be `None`. The wording differs slightly, but the semantic meaning is the same.
