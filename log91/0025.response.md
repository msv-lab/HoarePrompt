SAME: True  
REASON: The expected and computed postconditions both describe the same logical state of the program. They specify that `a` is a string with a length greater than 5 and that `b` is the uppercase version of `a`. Despite slight differences in wording, the semantic meaning is equivalent, indicating that both postconditions describe the same program state.
