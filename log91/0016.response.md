SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program. They specify that `numerator` and `denominator` are numeric values and detail the behavior of `result` based on the value of `denominator`. Both conditions state that if the `denominator` is zero, `result` is None, and if the `denominator` is not zero, `result` is equal to `numerator / denominator`. The slight difference in the order of clauses does not affect the semantic meaning, which remains consistent between the two descriptions.
