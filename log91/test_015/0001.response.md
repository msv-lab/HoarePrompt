`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, which is 1. `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`, which is 0 * 1 = 0. After execution, `prev` is now 1 and `curr` is 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
