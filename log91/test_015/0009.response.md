To analyze the output state after the completion of the while loop given the initial state and the loop code, we will consider the behavior of the variables through the iterations of the loop.

Initial State: `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer.

From the provided output states after each iteration:

- After executing the loop 1 time:
  - `prev` is 1
  - `curr` is 0
  - `i` is 1

- After executing the loop 2 times:
  - `prev` is 0
  - `curr` is 1
  - `i` is 2

- After executing the loop 3 times:
  - `prev` is 1
  - `curr` is 0
  - `i` is 3
  - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

From this analysis, we observe that:

- The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- After the first iteration, `prev` and `curr` swap values, and `curr` becomes 0 after the first iteration.
- By the second iteration, `prev` becomes 0 and `curr` becomes 1, continuing this pattern.
- It alternates between `prev` being 0 or 1 and `curr` being 1 or 0, depending on whether `i` is even or odd.

If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop executes until `i` equals `n`, meaning that when the loop ends, `i` will equal `n + 1`, and thus the loop condition will no longer hold.

Given this, when the loop completes:

- If `n` is even, `prev` will be 0 and `curr` will be 1.
- If `n` is odd, `prev` will be 1 and `curr` will be 0.
- In either case, `i` will be `n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `prev` is 0 if `n` is even, 1 if `n` is odd, `curr` is 1 if `n` is even, 0 if `n` is odd.**
