According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, but we do not have information about `n`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be equal to or greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it meets this condition. 

State: **`prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
