The values of `prev` and `curr` are swapped, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`. Initially, `prev` is 1 and `curr` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `prev` will be 0 (the previous value of `curr`), and `curr` will be 1 (since 1 * 0 equals 0). The value of `i` and the condition for the loop are not affected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1**
