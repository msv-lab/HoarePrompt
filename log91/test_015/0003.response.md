According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, but we do not have information about `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time since `i` is currently 1.

State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1**
