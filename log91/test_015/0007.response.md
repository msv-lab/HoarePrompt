The code `prev, curr = curr, prev * curr` assigns the value of `curr` to `prev` and the product of `prev` and `curr` to `curr`. 

- Initially, `prev` is 0 and `curr` is 1.
- After execution: 
  - `prev` becomes the previous value of `curr`, which is 1.
  - `curr` becomes the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr`, which is `0 * 1 = 0`.

The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2**.
