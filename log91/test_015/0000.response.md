According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Thus, no adjustments are needed for `i`, and `n` being a non-negative integer allows the loop to execute. 

State: **`prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is a non-negative integer**
