SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition specifies two scenarios: if `x` equals `y`, then `z` is the sum of `x` and `y`, and if `x` is less than `y`, then `z` is the difference between `y` and `x`. The computed postcondition correctly identifies that when `x` equals `y`, `z` is `2 * x` (which is the same as the sum of `x` and `y`), but it diverges in the second scenario. The computed postcondition states that if `x` is not equal to `y` and `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `z` is a positive integer, which is less specific and does not align with the expected result of `z` being the difference between `y` and `x`. Thus, the computed postcondition does not fully capture the logic described in the expected postcondition.
