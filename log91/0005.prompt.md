Given the following two postconditions for a Python function:

1. Expected Postcondition: A description of the state of the program that should hold after executing the given code.
2. Computed Postcondition: A description of the state of the program generated by a tool based on the provided precondition and code.

Your task is to determine whether these two postconditions are semantically relatively the same, meaning they describe a very similar logical program state or behavior. You do not need to check for exact wording, but their semantic meaning must align.

For your response, provide:

- SAME: **True or False** (True if they describe the same state semantically; False if not).
- REASON: **The reason why the postconditions are the same or not**.

Here are the two postconditions:

Expected Postcondition:  
total is the sum of integers from inner_counter to 1 for each value of outer_counter, inner_counter is 0, outer_counter is 0

Computed Postcondition:  
`outer_counter` is 0, `inner_counter` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers from the original value of `inner_counter` down to 1 multiplied by the original value of `outer_counter`.

Your Response: 

SAME: **True or False**  
REASON: **Explanation for the decision**
