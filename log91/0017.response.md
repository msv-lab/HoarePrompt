SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe a scenario where `filename` is a string that represents a valid file path. They agree that if the file exists, `content` contains the text of the file. If the file does not exist, both agree that `content` is an empty string. While the Computed Postcondition adds the detail that `file` is an open file object in read mode when the file is found, this does not contradict or change the state described by the Expected Postcondition regarding `content`. Thus, semantically, they describe the same state regarding the content of the file and its handling.
