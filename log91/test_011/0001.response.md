`z` is assigned the value of `x - y`. Since `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is less than 0, the expression `x - y` results in a value that is greater than `x` (because subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its absolute value). Therefore, the exact value of `z` cannot be determined without specific values for `x` and `y`, but it can be concluded that `z` will be a positive integer. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is greater than 0, `y` is less than 0, and `z` is greater than `x`.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `y` is less than 0, and `z` is greater than `x`.**
