According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `inner_counter` is an integer greater than 0, so the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0; `total` is equal to `inner_counter - 1`**
