The value of `total` is increased by the value of `inner_counter`. Since `inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0, `total` will be incremented by that value, but we do not have the specific value of `inner_counter` to provide an exact numeric result. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0; `total` is increased by `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0; `total` is increased by `inner_counter**
