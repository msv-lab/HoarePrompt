The value of `inner_counter` is decremented by 1. Since `inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0, it will still remain non-negative after the operation. The state of `total` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is decreased by 1; `total` remains increased by `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is decreased by 1; `total` remains increased by `inner_counter`**
