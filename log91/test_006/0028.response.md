According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `inner_counter` is now less than its original value but greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `inner_counter` must be strictly greater than 0. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. The other variables `outer_counter` and `total` do not affect the execution of the loop in this case.

State: **`inner_counter` is adjusted to be greater than 0, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1, `total` remains increased by the original value of `inner_counter`**
