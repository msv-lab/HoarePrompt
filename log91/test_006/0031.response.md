According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `inner_counter` is one less than its original value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the original value of `inner_counter` must have been at least 2 (which means `inner_counter` currently must be greater than 0). 

The other states, `outer_counter` and `total`, do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, as they do not directly impact the condition for the `while` loop.

State: **`inner_counter` is one less than its original value and for the loop to execute again `inner_counter` must be greater than 0**
