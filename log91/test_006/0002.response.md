`total` is assigned the value `total + inner_counter`. The previous value of `total` is 0, so after execution, `total` will be equal to `inner_counter`. The states of the other variables (`outer_counter` and `inner_counter`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0; `total` is equal to `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0; `total` is equal to `inner_counter**
