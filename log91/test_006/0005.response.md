The value of `total` is updated by adding `inner_counter` to it. The initial value of `total` is `inner_counter - 1`, so after the operation, `total` becomes `(inner_counter - 1) + inner_counter`, which simplifies to `2 * inner_counter - 1`. The values of `outer_counter` and `inner_counter` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is greater than 0, `total` is `2 * inner_counter - 1`.

Output State: **`outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is greater than 0, `total` is `2 * inner_counter - 1`**
