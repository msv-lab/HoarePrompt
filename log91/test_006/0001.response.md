According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `inner_counter` is an integer greater than 0, which means it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. 

Since both `outer_counter` and `total` do not affect the execution condition of the `while` loop, they do not need to be adjusted. 

State: **`outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0, `total` is 0**
