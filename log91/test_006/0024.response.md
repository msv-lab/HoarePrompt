According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `outer_counter`. If `outer_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `outer_counter` must be adjusted to be greater than 0. Since it is currently less than or equal to its original value minus 1, it would need to be at least 1 more than its current value. 

Therefore, to ensure `outer_counter` is greater than 0, we should adjust it to be at least 1. 

State: **`inner_counter` is 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and for the loop to execute again `outer_counter` must be adjusted to be greater than 0**
