`inner_counter` is decremented by 1. The values of `outer_counter` and `total` remain unaffected. The previous value of `inner_counter` is greater than 0, so after execution, `inner_counter` will be one less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value, `total` is `2 * inner_counter - 1`.

Output State: **`outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value, `total` is `2 * inner_counter - 1**
