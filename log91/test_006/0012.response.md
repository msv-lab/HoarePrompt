According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `outer_counter`. If `outer_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, which means it is currently 0 or negative. For the loop to execute one more time, `outer_counter` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`inner_counter` is 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1 and for the loop to execute again `outer_counter` must be greater than 0**
