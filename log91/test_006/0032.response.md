The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `inner_counter`. Since `inner_counter` is one less than its original value, it is still greater than 0, allowing the addition to proceed. The exact value of `inner_counter` is not given, but it is known that it is positive. The value of `total` is affected by this addition, but the previous value of `total` is unknown.

Output State: **`total` is increased by `inner_counter`, where `inner_counter` is greater than 0.**
