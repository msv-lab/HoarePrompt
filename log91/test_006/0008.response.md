`total` is increased by the value of `inner_counter`. Since `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value and is greater than 1, we can denote its current value as `inner_counter`. The impact of the code on `total` is that it now becomes `total + inner_counter`. The previous state of `total` is adjusted to `2 * inner_counter - 1`, so the new value of `total` can be calculated as follows: 

New `total` = `(2 * inner_counter - 1) + inner_counter = 3 * inner_counter - 1`.

The states of `outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value and greater than 1; `total` is adjusted to `3 * inner_counter - 1`.

Output State: **`outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value and greater than 1; `total` is adjusted to `3 * inner_counter - 1**
