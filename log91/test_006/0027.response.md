The value of `inner_counter` is decremented by 1. Since `inner_counter` is initially greater than 0, after the execution, it will be less than its original value but still greater than or equal to 0. The values of `outer_counter` and `total` remain unaffected in this specific code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is now less than its original value but greater than or equal to 0; `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1; `total` remains increased by the original value of `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is now less than its original value but greater than or equal to 0; `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1; `total` remains increased by the original value of `inner_counter.**
