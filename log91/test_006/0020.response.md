`total` is assigned the value of `total + inner_counter`. Since `inner_counter` must have been at least 2 before the last iteration, the minimum value of `inner_counter` is 1 now (it has decreased by 1). Therefore, `total` is increased by at least 1. The exact new value of `total` depends on its previous value, which is unknown. 

Output State: **`total` is increased by at least 1; `inner_counter` is at least 1**
