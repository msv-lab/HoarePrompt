The value of `total` is increased by the original value of `inner_counter`. The state of `inner_counter` is greater than 0, so `total` will increase by a positive value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1, `total` is increased by the original value of `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1, `total` is increased by the original value of `inner_counter**
