The loop executes as long as `inner_counter` is greater than 0. Each iteration of the loop decreases `inner_counter` by 1 and increases `total` by the current value of `inner_counter`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, `inner_counter` will be 0, and `total` will have accumulated the sum of all values from the initial value of `inner_counter` down to 1. Since `outer_counter` is stated to be less than or equal to its original value minus 1, it does not impact the final values of `inner_counter` or `total`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has completed is:
Output State: **`inner_counter` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers from the original value of `inner_counter` down to 1, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1.**
