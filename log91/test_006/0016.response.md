According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `inner_counter` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0, and for the loop to execute again `inner_counter` must be greater than 0**
