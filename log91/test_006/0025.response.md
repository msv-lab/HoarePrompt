According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. The loop can only execute if `inner_counter` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `inner_counter` is 0, which means the loop cannot execute. To allow the loop to execute for the first time, `inner_counter` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1**
