According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `inner_counter` is 0, which means it cannot execute. For the loop to execute the first time, `inner_counter` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

State: **`inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1 and for the loop to execute again `outer_counter` must be greater than 0**
