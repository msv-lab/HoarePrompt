`inner_counter` is decremented by 1, and since its initial state is greater than 0, it will still remain greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement. The values of `outer_counter` and `total` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is greater than or equal to 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by `inner_counter.**
