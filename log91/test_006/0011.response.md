The value of `outer_counter` is decremented by 1, while the values of `inner_counter` and `total` remain unchanged. The previous value of `outer_counter` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is the sum of all integers from 1 to 0, which is 0.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, `total` is 0**
