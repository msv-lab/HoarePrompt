The value of `inner_counter` is decremented by 1. Since `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the new value of `inner_counter` will still be greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement. The other variables (`outer_counter` and `total`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is now one less than its original value, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by the original value of `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is now one less than its original value; `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1; `total` is increased by the original value of `inner_counter.**
