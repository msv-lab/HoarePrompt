The value of `total` is incremented by `inner_counter`. Since `inner_counter` is greater than 0, `total` will increase by a positive amount. The value of `outer_counter` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by `inner_counter.**
