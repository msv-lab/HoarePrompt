According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `inner_counter` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `inner_counter` must currently be greater than 0. This means it must have been at least 1 before it was decreased, which indicates that it should have been at least 2 before the last iteration.

State: **`inner_counter` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `inner_counter` must currently be greater than 0, so it should have been at least 2 before the last iteration**
