The value of `inner_counter` is decremented by 1, and since it was previously greater than 1, it remains greater than 1 after the operation. The `outer_counter` and `total` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value and greater than 1; `total` is adjusted to `3 * inner_counter - 1`.

Output State: **`outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value and greater than 1; `total` is adjusted to `3 * inner_counter - 1.**
