According to the code, the loop can execute again if `inner_counter` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value, which implies it is currently positive. However, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `inner_counter` must be adjusted to be greater than 1 because it was decreased by 1 in the last iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `inner_counter` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. The state of `total` will also need to be modified accordingly, since it is defined as `2 * inner_counter - 1`.

State: **`outer_counter` is greater than 0, `inner_counter` is now one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute again `inner_counter` is greater than 1, and `total` is adjusted to `2 * inner_counter - 1`**
