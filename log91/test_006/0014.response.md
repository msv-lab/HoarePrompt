The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `inner_counter`. Since `inner_counter` is greater than 0, this means that `total` will increase by a positive value. The previous value of `total` is unknown, but it will now be updated to reflect the addition of `inner_counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by `inner_counter`.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is greater than 0, `outer_counter` is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1, and `total` is increased by `inner_counter.**
