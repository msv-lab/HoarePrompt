The value of `outer_counter` is decremented by 1, reducing it from its original value to a new value, which is now less than or equal to its original value minus 1. The values of `inner_counter` and `total` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inner_counter` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers from the original value of `inner_counter` down to 1, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1.

Output State: **`inner_counter` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers from the original value of `inner_counter` down to 1, `outer_counter` is less than or equal to its original value minus 1.**
