The value of `inner_counter` is decreased by 1, but the specific previous value of `inner_counter` is unknown other than it being greater than 0. The variable `total` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is increased by `inner_counter`, `inner_counter` is decreased by 1 (meaning it is now still greater than or equal to 0).

Output State: **`total` is increased by `inner_counter`, `inner_counter` is decreased by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0)**
