According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `outer_counter`. If `outer_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `outer_counter` is an integer greater than 0, which means it is already suitable for the loop to execute for the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0, `total` is 0**
