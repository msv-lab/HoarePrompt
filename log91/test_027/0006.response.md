`z` is assigned the value of `y - x`. Since `x` is an integer and `y` is an integer, the result of `y - x` will also be an integer. The previous relationship states that `x` is not equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to `y`, which implies that `y - x` will be a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `z` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `z` is a positive integer.**
