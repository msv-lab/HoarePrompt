`z` is assigned the value of `x + y`. Since `x` is equal to `y`, we can say that `z` will be equal to `x + x`, which simplifies to `2 * x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `x` is equal to `y`; `z` is equal to `2 * x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `x` is equal to `y`; `z` is equal to `2 * x`**
