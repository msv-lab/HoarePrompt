`counter` is decremented by 1. Since `counter` was originally an integer greater than 0, after the operation, `counter` will still be a non-negative integer (specifically, it will be 0 or more). The value of `total` remains unchanged, as it is equal to the original value of `counter`. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `total` is equal to the original value of `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `total` is equal to the original value of `counter`**
