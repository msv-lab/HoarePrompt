According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `counter`. If `counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `counter` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and since `total` is equal to the original value of `counter`, for the loop to execute one more time, `counter` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `counter` to be greater than 0.

State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is equal to the original value of `counter`**
