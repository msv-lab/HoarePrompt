`total` is incremented by the value of `counter`, which is an integer greater than 0. Given that `total` starts at 0, after the execution, `total` will now be equal to the value of `counter`. The state of `counter` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is equal to `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is equal to `counter**
