The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `counter`. Since `total` is initially equal to the original value of `counter`, the new value of `total` becomes `total + counter`, which is `counter + counter` or `2 * counter`. The state of `counter` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0; `total` is equal to `2 * counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0; `total` is equal to `2 * counter**
