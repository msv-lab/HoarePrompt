According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `counter`. If `counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `counter` is an integer greater than 0 after being decremented by 1, which means it must be at least 1. Since `total` is equal to `2 * counter` before the decrement, for the loop to execute one more time, `counter` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 after the decrement. 

So, if `counter` was decremented by 1 and is still greater than 0, it must have been at least 2 before the decrement. Thus, to ensure that `counter` remains greater than 0, we can state that `counter` needs to be at least 2 before the decrement.

State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0 after being decremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `counter` must be at least 2 before the decrement.**
