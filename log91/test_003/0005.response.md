`counter` is decremented by 1. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0, its new value will still be a positive integer. The value of `total` remains unchanged as it is dependent on `counter` but is not directly modified by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0 after being decremented by 1; `total` is equal to `2 * counter` before the decrement.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0 after being decremented by 1; `total` is equal to `2 * counter` before the decrement.**
