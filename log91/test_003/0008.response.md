`counter` is decremented by 1. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0, its new value will be a positive integer (specifically, one less than its previous value). The variable `total` remains unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0 (now decreased by 1), `total` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0 (now decreased by 1), `total` remains unchanged**
