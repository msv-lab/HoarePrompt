`z` is assigned the value of `y`, but the values of `x` and `y` are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `z` takes the value of `y`, while `x` remains unchanged. The initial condition that `x` is less than or equal to 0 is not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0; `y` is an integer; `z` is assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `y` is an integer; `z` is assigned the value of `y`**
