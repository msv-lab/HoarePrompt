`z` is assigned the value of `x - y`. Since `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is less than or equal to 0, the expression `x - y` results in a value greater than `x`. This means `z` will be a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is greater than 0, `y` is less than or equal to 0, and `z` is a positive integer greater than `x`.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `y` is less than or equal to 0, and `z` is a positive integer greater than `x`.**
