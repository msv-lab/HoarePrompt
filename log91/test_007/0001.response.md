`y` is assigned the value of `x + 1`. Given that `x` is an integer and is greater than 0, `y` will be an integer value that is one greater than `x`. The state of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0; `y` is an integer equal to `x + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0; `y` is an integer equal to `x + 1**
