`y` is assigned the value of `-x`. Since `x` is an integer and is less than or equal to 0, the value of `-x` will be either 0 or a positive integer. The value of `y` will therefore be 0 or a positive integer. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer (less than or equal to 0), `y` is 0 or a positive integer**
