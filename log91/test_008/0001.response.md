`y` is assigned the value of `x`, and since `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` will also take on this positive integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0; `y` is equal to `x`.
Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0; `y` is equal to `x`**
