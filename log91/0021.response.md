SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the following state after the program execution: `x` is an integer that is either 0 or negative (i.e., `x <= 0`). The value of `y` is the negation of `x`, meaning that if `x` is 0, `y` is 0, otherwise `y` is positive. This aligns with the computed postcondition where `y` is described as either 0 or a positive integer. Therefore, semantically, both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program.
