The value of `total` is increased by the last element popped from the list `numbers`. Since `numbers` has at least one element, `numbers.pop()` will remove and return that last element, which will be added to `total`. This operation modifies `numbers` by reducing its length by one. Therefore, the updated state after executing this code is as follows:

Output State: **`total` is the last value of `numbers` plus the last element of `numbers`, `numbers` is the original list with one less element**
