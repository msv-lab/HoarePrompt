According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. The loop will execute as long as `numbers` is not empty. Right before the loop, `numbers` is a list of integers. For the loop to execute, the list must contain at least one integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `numbers` needs to be a non-empty list.

State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers**
