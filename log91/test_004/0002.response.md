According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element. Since it is mentioned that `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, this means that it still contains at least one integer. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`total` is the last value of `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element**.
