The code `total += numbers.pop()` modifies the `total` and `numbers` variables. The `pop()` method removes the last element from the `numbers` list and returns it. This value is then added to `total`. Initially, `total` is 0, so after executing the code, `total` will be equal to the last element removed from `numbers`. The `numbers` list will have one fewer element after execution.

Output State: **`total` is the last value of `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element.**
