According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is the original list with one less element, which means it still has elements left unless it originally had only one element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must contain at least one element. Therefore, if the original list had more than one element, `numbers` must still have at least one element. 

State: **`total` is the last value of `numbers` plus the last element of `numbers`; `numbers` is the original list with one less element and for the loop to execute again, `numbers` must contain at least one element**.
