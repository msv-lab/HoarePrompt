The value of `numbers.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `numbers`. The current value of `total` is updated by adding this last element to it. The list `numbers` will now have one less element after this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `total` and the modified list of `numbers`.

Output State: **`total` is the last value of `numbers` plus the last element of `numbers`; `numbers` is the original list with one less element.**
