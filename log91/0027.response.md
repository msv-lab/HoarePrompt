SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program: `x` is an integer between 6 and 10 inclusive, and `y` is `x - 5`. The expected postcondition states `y` is `x - 5`, which results in `y` being 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 when `x` is between 6 and 10. The computed postcondition directly lists the possible values of `y` that result from this calculation. Therefore, the two postconditions are semantically the same.
