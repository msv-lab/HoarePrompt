`z` is assigned the value `x + y`. Given that `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than or equal to 0, the resulting value of `z` could be less than, equal to, or greater than `x`, depending on the specific values of `x` and `y`. However, since `y` is non-positive, `z` will always be less than `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers; `z` is `x + y`, which is less than `x`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers; `z` is `x + y`, which is less than `x`.**
