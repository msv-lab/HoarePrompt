SAME: True  
REASON: Both the expected and computed postconditions describe the same logical state: `x` is a positive integer and is odd. The expected postcondition combines these two properties into a single statement, while the computed postcondition explicitly states them as separate conditions. Semantically, both describe the same state of `x` being a positive odd integer.
