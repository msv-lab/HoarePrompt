SAME: True  
REASON: Both the Expected Postcondition and the Computed Postcondition describe the same logical outcomes based on the state of `input_string`. They both assert that `input_string` is a string. They specify that if `input_string` represents a valid non-zero integer, the result is the division of `100` by `value`. If `input_string` does not represent a valid integer, the result is 'Invalid input'. Finally, both state that if `input_string` represents zero, the result is 'Cannot divide by zero'. Despite minor differences in wording, the semantic content and logical conditions described are equivalent.
