SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition describes `total` as the sum of integers from `inner_counter` to 1 for each value of `outer_counter`, implying that this summation process happens multiple times based on `outer_counter`. Meanwhile, the computed postcondition describes `total` as the sum of integers from the original `inner_counter` down to 1, multiplied by the original value of `outer_counter`, which implies a single computation based on initial values and multiplication, rather than iterating over `outer_counter`. These represent different logical states: one is accumulative over iterations, while the other is a direct computation involving multiplication.
