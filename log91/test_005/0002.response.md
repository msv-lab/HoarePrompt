`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, which is an integer from the `row` of the `matrix`. Since the initial state indicates that `total` is 0, after executing `total += num`, the new value of `total` will be `num`. The states of the other variables (`matrix` and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is now `num`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `row` is the first row in the matrix containing at least 1 integer.

Output State: **`total` is now `num`, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `row` is the first row in the matrix containing at least 1 integer**.
