According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `matrix`. If the `matrix` is a non-empty 2D list, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `total` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. For the loop to execute, `matrix` must contain at least one row, and `row` will be set to the first row of the `matrix`. 

State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `row` is the first row in the matrix**
