The value of `total` is incremented by `num`, which is the second element in `row`. Since `total` was already equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix`, and `num` is defined, `total` will now reflect this new value. The specific resulting value of `total` is not provided, but it will be the sum of the first row of `matrix` plus `num`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus `num`, `row` is the second row of `matrix` with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `row`**
