According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If the `row` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is now `num`, and `row` contains at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `total` will be updated to the next integer in the `row`, and the loop will continue as long as there are more integers to iterate over.

State: **`total` is now `num`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must contain at least 2 integers, and `num` will be the next integer in the `row`.**
