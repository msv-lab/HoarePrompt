According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `matrix`. If the `matrix` has more than one row, the loop can execute again for the next row. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the first row of `matrix`, and `total` is equal to the sum of all integers in that first row. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `matrix` must have at least 2 rows, and `row` should be the second row of `matrix`.

State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix`, `row` is the second row of `matrix`, for the loop to execute a second time `matrix` must have at least 2 rows**
