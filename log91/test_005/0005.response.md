According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` iterable. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is now `num`, and after processing the current `num`, `total` has increased to `num + num`, which is `2 * num`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `num` should come from `row`, and the state of `total` needs to reflect the new value of `num`. If there is at least one more element in `row`, then `num` will be the next element, and `total` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`total` is `2 * num`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more element, and `num` is the next element in `row`.**
