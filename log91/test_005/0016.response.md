According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `matrix`. If the `matrix` has more rows, the loop can execute again for the next row. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the second row of `matrix`, and `num` is the last element in that row. For the loop to execute one more time, the `matrix` must have at least three rows, and `row` should be updated to the third row of the matrix. 

State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus the sum of all integers in the second row of `matrix`, `row` is the third row of `matrix`, and `num` is the last element in `row`.**
