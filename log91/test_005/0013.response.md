According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains the elements of the second row of `matrix`, and `num` is currently the third element in that row. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next element in `row`. Therefore, `num` must now take the value of the fourth element in the `row`, and the index used to track the position within `row` should be updated accordingly.

For the loop to execute again, `row` must contain a fourth element, which means it must have at least 4 elements in total.

State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus `2 * num`, `row` is the second row of `matrix`, `num` is the fourth element in `row`**
