According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element in the `row` list. 

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must have at least 2 elements, and during the next iteration, `num` will be the second element in the list. 

State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus the sum of all integers in the second row of `matrix` plus `num`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must be a list with at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second element of `row`**
