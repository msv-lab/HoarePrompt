The value of `total` is incremented by `num`. Since `total` is initially equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus `num`, adding `num` again results in `total` being increased by `num` once more. The value of `total` is now equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus `2 * num`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus `2 * num`, `row` is the second row of `matrix`, and `num` is the third element in `row`.

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in the first row of `matrix` plus `2 * num`, `row` is the second row of `matrix`, `num` is the third element in `row**
