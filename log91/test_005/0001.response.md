According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one integer. Before the loop starts, `total` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `matrix` must be a 2D list with at least 1 row, and `row` should be set to the first row of that matrix, which contains at least 1 integer.

State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `row` is the first row in the matrix containing at least 1 integer**
