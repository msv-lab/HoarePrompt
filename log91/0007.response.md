SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition specifies that if `x` is greater than 0, then `y` should be equal to `x`, and if `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `y` should be `-x`. This means that `y` should be the negative of `x` when `x` is less than or equal to 0, which would make `y` either 0 or a positive integer. However, the computed postcondition states that if `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `y` is either 0 or a positive integer without explicitly stating that `y` is `-x`. The computed postcondition does not account for the case where `x` is negative and `y` should be equal to `-x`, hence they do not semantically align.
