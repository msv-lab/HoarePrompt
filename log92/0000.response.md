SAME: False  
REASON: The two postconditions differ in their description of the second case, when `x > 0` and `y <= 0`. The Expected Postcondition specifies that `z` should be `x - y`, while the Computed Postcondition states that `z` is greater than or equal to `x`. These are not semantically equivalent because `x - y` can be less than `x` if `y` is positive, which contradicts the Computed Postcondition's assertion that `z` is greater than or equal to `x`. The other conditions are consistent between the two postconditions, but this discrepancy in the second case makes the overall postconditions semantically different.
