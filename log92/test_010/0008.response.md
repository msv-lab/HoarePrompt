Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `z` is the sum of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than 0 but `y` is less than or equal to 0, then `z` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `z` is assigned the value of `y`.***
