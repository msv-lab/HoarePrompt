The value of `z` is assigned the result of `x - y`. Given that `x` is a positive integer (greater than 0) and `y` is an integer that is less than or equal to 0, the result of `x - y` will always be greater than or equal to `x` (since subtracting a negative or zero from a positive number increases its value). Therefore, the output state reflects the conditions of `x` and `y`, along with the computed value of `z`. 

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `y` is less than or equal to 0, `z` is greater than or equal to `x`**
