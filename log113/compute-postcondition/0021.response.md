The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. The parameter `n` is a non-negative integer, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The parameter `dp` is a dictionary with keys as tuples of (n, k) and values as integers. 

After executing the function body, the function checks the following cases:
- Case 1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
- Case 2: The function returns the value associated with the key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.
- Case 3: If `n` is a non-negative integer less than 10 and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10, the function returns the value of `dp[n, k]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`, returning 0 if `k` is 0, returning the value associated with (n, k) in `dp`, and returning the value of `dp[n, k]` based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (non-negative integer), k (positive integer between 1 and 10), and dp (dictionary), returning 0 if k is 0, the value associated with (n, k) in dp, or the value of dp[n, k] depending on the input conditions.**
