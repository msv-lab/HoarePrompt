The expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` updates the value of `dp[n, k]`.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 10, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is 2, we can calculate the updated value of `dp[n, k]` as follows:

1. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is `90 + 9 * 10`, which equals `90 + 90 = 180`.
2. Calculate the term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)`:
   - Since `i` is 2, this becomes `9 * 10 ** (2 - 1) = 9 * 10 ** 1 = 90`.
3. Calculate the term `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)`:
   - `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.
   - `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** 1 = 10`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `10 ** (k - 2) - 10`.
4. The complete update of `dp[n, k]` becomes:
   - `dp[n, k] += 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.

The overall output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[n, k]` after the operation, but without knowing the specific value of `k`, we leave it in general terms.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 10; `k` is greater than or equal to 3; dp[n, k] is updated to 180 + 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10); `i` is 2.**
