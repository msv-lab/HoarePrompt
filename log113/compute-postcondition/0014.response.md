According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning that the loop has executed at least once (with `i` being 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3, allowing `i` to take the value of 2 during the next iteration. Hence, the updated state should reflect that `i` is now 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 10; `k` must be greater than or equal to 3; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `90 + 9 * 10; i is 2**
