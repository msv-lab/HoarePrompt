Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 10), and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the value associated with the key `(n, k)` in `dp` if it exists, or calculates and returns a specific value based on `n` and `k` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`. The calculation involves updating `dp[n, k]` to either `n` or a formula involving powers of 10 and modular arithmetic if `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`.**
