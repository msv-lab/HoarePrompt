The line of code modifies `dp[n, k]` by applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The variable `dp[n, k]` was previously updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10`, which means it has a specific value based on its previous state. The modulo operation ensures that `dp[n, k]` will be within the range defined by `MOD`.

After executing the code, the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated to be `dp[n, k] + 90` (since `9 * 10 = 90`), and then it is taken modulo `MOD`.

The initial states of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 10; `k` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `(dp[n, k] + 90) % MOD`**.
