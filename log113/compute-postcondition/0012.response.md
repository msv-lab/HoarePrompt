According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `k - 1`. Since `k` is greater than or equal to `2`, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken a value between `1` and `k - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. If `i` is currently at its maximum value, which would be `k - 2` at the end of the last iteration, then `i` will be incremented to `k - 1` for the next iteration and will not execute again.

Given that the state says `k` is greater than or equal to `2`, if the last value of `i` was `k - 2`, then `i` will increase to `k - 1` for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we should adjust the conditions accordingly.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 10; `k` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[n, k]` is now `9 * 10; i is k - 2`**
