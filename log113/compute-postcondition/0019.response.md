Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `n` is less than `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`, and the tuple (`n`, `k`) is added as a key in `dp`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[n, k]` is updated to `(dp[n, k] + 90) % MOD`.***
