Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with keys as tuples of (`n`, `k`) and values as integers, `k` is greater than 0, and the tuple (`n`, `k`) is not a key in `dp`. The current value of `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`.***
