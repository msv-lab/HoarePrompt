The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (with constraints \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)) and an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)). It computes and returns the result of the expression \((func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) \% MOD\), where `dp` is an empty dictionary. The function assumes that `func_2` correctly calculates some value based on `r`, `k`, and `dp`, but the details of this calculation are not provided in the code. There are no checks for invalid inputs, but the function operates under the assumption that inputs adhere to the stated constraints.
