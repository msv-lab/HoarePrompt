#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(l, r, k):

    #The program returns the result of the expression (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where func_2 is a function that takes r, k, and dp as arguments, and dp is an empty dictionary. The values of l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (with constraints \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)) and an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)). It computes and returns the result of the expression \((func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) \% MOD\), where `dp` is an empty dictionary. The function assumes that `func_2` correctly calculates some value based on `r`, `k`, and `dp`, but the details of this calculation are not provided in the code. There are no checks for invalid inputs, but the function operates under the assumption that inputs adhere to the stated constraints.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with keys as tuples of (`n`, `k`) and values as integers, `k` is greater than 0, and the tuple (`n`, `k`) is not a key in `dp`
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 10; `k` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * (10^k - 10)`
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)

    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value of dp[n, k], where n is a non-negative integer less than 10 and k is a positive integer between 1 and 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 10), and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the value associated with the key `(n, k)` in `dp` if it exists, or calculates and returns a specific value based on `n` and `k` if `(n, k)` is not in `dp`. The calculation involves updating `dp[n, k]` to either `n` or a formula involving powers of 10 and modular arithmetic if `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`.
