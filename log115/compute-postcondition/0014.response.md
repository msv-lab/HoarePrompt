Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` that represents a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of the elements from the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal. If the matrix is empty (i.e., has no rows), it returns 0. Note that for a matrix of odd size, the center element is counted twice, which may lead to an unexpected increase in the total sum.**
