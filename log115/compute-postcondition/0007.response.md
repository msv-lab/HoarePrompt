The code updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is currently 1, we replace `i` with 1 in the expression:

- The new value of `total` becomes: 
  - `total = total + matrix[1][n - 1 - 1]` 
  - Which simplifies to: 
  - `total = total + matrix[1][n - 2]`

The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the updated `total`.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**.
