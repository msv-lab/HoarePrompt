The variable `total` is incremented by the value at `matrix[i][i]`. Given that `total` is initially 0 and `i` is 0, we can express the new value of `total` as `total + matrix[0][0]`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `matrix` is expected to be a valid 2D array with at least one element.

The output state reflects the updated value of `total`, but we do not know the specific value of `matrix[0][0]`. Therefore, we express it in terms of that variable.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
