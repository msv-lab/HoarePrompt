The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `total` will be equal to its previous value plus `matrix[1][1]`. Since the initial value of `total` is defined as `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, the output state will reflect this new value of `total`. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and their conditions are still valid.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
