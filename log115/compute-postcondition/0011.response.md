To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, consider the following:

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the square matrix. During each iteration, two elements from the matrix are added to `total`: the element from the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the element from the anti-diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`). 

1. After the loop has executed `n` times, the `total` will be the sum of all elements from both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.
2. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0.

Now summarizing the conditions based on the loop execution:

- For the loop to execute a certain number of times, `n` must be at least that number.
- After executing `n` times, `i` will equal `n - 1`.

Thus, the final output state can be formulated as follows:

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all elements from the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of `matrix`, `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is greater than 0 then `total` is the sum involving `n` elements, else `total` is 0.**
