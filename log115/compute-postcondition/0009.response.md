`total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `matrix[2][2]` is added to `total`. The initial value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
