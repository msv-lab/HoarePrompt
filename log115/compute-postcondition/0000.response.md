The variable `n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, which calculates the number of rows (or columns) in the square matrix. Since the initial state indicates that `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` will be equal to the number of rows (or columns) in that matrix. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers; `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in `matrix`.**
