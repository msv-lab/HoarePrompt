According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again. Since `i` will be incremented by 1 before the next iteration, `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
