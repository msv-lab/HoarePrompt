The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. After executing the function body, if the size of the matrix (n) is not greater than 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the value of total, which is equal to the sum of all elements from the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix of integers and return the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements, or 0 if the matrix size is not greater than 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix, which is a square matrix of integers, and returns the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements, or 0 if the matrix size is not greater than 0.**
