The variable `y` is assigned the value of `100 * x`. Given that `x` is an integer, less than or equal to 10, less than or equal to 5, and greater than 0, the possible values for `x` are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Consequently, `y` will take the values 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 respectively, depending on the specific value of `x`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is less than or equal to 5, `x` is greater than 0; `y` is either 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 depending on the value of `x`.**
