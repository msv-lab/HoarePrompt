`y` is assigned the value of `x * 10`. Since `x` is an integer with a value greater than 10, `y` will be a value greater than 100. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 10; `y` is a value equal to `x * 10`, which is greater than 100.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 10; `y` is a value equal to `x * 10`, which is greater than 100.**
