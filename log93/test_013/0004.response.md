`y` is assigned the value of `20 * x`. Given that `x` is an integer, less than or equal to 10, and greater than 5, the possible values for `x` are 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Therefore, `y` will take on the values 120, 140, 160, 180, or 200 respectively based on the value of `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10; `y` is either 120, 140, 160, 180, or 200 depending on the value of `x`.**
