SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the behavior of the variables `x` and `y` under the same conditions with respect to the value of `x`. They both assert that `x` is an integer. For `x > 10`, both postconditions agree that `y` is 10 times `x`. For `5 < x <= 10`, both describe `y` as 20 times `x`, listing the possible values that result from this multiplication. For `0 < x <= 5`, both describe `y` as 100 times `x`, again listing the possible outcomes. Lastly, for `x <= 0`, both postconditions agree that `y` is not restricted by these conditions, with the expected postcondition allowing any value and the computed postcondition stating `y` remains unchanged, which aligns with having any value. Hence, they semantically describe the same state.
