The function accepts a list of integers `my_list`. It returns 0 if the length of the list is even or if the list has 3 or more elements. If the length of the list is odd and less than 3, it returns the integer at index 1 of the list, which may not exist if the list has only one element. Therefore, if `my_list` has only one element, it will lead to an IndexError.
