Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that calculates the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in the list and starts over when encountering a zero. However, the program does not perform any such calculations. 

Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Return Values**: The function returns 0 if the length of the list is even or if it has 3 or more elements, which is unrelated to the cumulative product calculation as specified in the problem description.

2. **Handling of Non-zero Numbers**: There is no logic in the program to accumulate the product of non-zero numbers. The program simply returns an element from the list or 0, which does not align with the requirements.

3. **Index Error Risk**: The function attempts to return `my_list[1]`, but if `my_list` has only one element, it will lead to an IndexError. This is not addressed in the problem description, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

In summary, the program does not implement the logic required to calculate the cumulative product of non-zero numbers and instead has arbitrary conditions that lead to a return value of 0 or a single list element. Thus, it does not meet the specifications of the problem description.
