Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic described in the problem description. According to the problem, the function must calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in the list, and if a 0 is encountered, it should add the product so far and start again. 

Here are the main issues with the program:

1. The function checks if the length of the list is even or odd and returns 0 without performing any calculations related to the cumulative product.
2. The second condition checks if the length is greater than or equal to 3 and also returns 0, which is unrelated to the required functionality.
3. The final return statement returns the value at index 1 of the list if it has passed the previous checks, which is not relevant to the cumulative product calculation.

Overall, the program does not follow the requirements set forth in the problem description, as it completely ignores the need to calculate a cumulative product and handle zeros appropriately. Thus, it fails to meet the criteria outlined in the problem.
