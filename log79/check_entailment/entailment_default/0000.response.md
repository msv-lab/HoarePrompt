The provided program is intended to calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in a list, resetting the product when a zero is encountered. However, the code does not implement any logic related to calculating a cumulative product or handling zeros; instead, it only checks the length of the list and returns specific values based on those checks.

Analyzing the code:
```python
def func_1(my_list):
    if len(my_list) % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    if len(my_list) >= 3:
        return 0
    return my_list[1]
```
1. **Length Check**: The first two conditions return 0 if the length of the list is even or if the length is 3 or more. This does not align with the problem description, which should focus on product calculations.
2. **Index Access**: The final return statement attempts to access the second element of the list (index 1), which can lead to an `IndexError` if the list has fewer than 2 elements. This is a critical flaw.

Output hints indicate that the function returns 0 under certain conditions and references the potential for an `IndexError` if the list has only one element. This aligns with the code's behavior, confirming that the function does not meet the problem's requirements.

Overall, the program does not implement the logic to compute the cumulative product as described. Instead, it incorrectly focuses on the length of the list and may produce errors based on the content of the list.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to meet the problem description by not calculating the cumulative product and also exposes a risk of an `IndexError` when accessing elements of the list.
