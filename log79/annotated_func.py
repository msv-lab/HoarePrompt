#State of the program right berfore the function call: my_list is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero numbers.
def func_1(my_list):
    if (len(my_list) % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero numbers. The length of `my_list` is odd.
    if (len(my_list) >= 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero numbers. The length of `my_list` is odd and less than 3.
    return my_list[1]
    #The program returns the integer at index 1 of the list 'my_list', which is of odd length and less than 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `my_list`. It returns 0 if the length of the list is even or if the list has 3 or more elements. If the length of the list is odd and less than 3, it returns the integer at index 1 of the list, which may not exist if the list has only one element. Therefore, if `my_list` has only one element, it will lead to an IndexError.
