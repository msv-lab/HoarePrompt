The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `my_list`. `my_list` is a list of integers, which may include zero and non-zero numbers. After executing the function body, the function has the following return conditions: 

- In Case_1, the function returns 0.
- In Case_2, the function returns 0.
- In Case_3, if `my_list` is of odd length and has less than 3 elements, the function returns the integer at index 1 of `my_list`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `my_list` and return 0 in certain cases, or return the integer at index 1 if the list is of odd length and contains less than 3 elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter my_list, which is a list of integers, and returns 0 in certain cases, or returns the integer at index 1 if my_list is of odd length and has less than 3 elements.**
