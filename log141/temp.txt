You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow respond with one word **True or False**.

# Your task:
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have a sessions dictionary that maps user IDs to session objects, where each session object has two keys:

"ref_count" (an integer >= 0): The number of “open references” or “active connections” for this user’s session.
"closed" (a boolean): Indicates whether the session is closed (True) or open (False).

If ref_count is 0, the session is marked closed (closed = True).
If ref_count is greater than 0, the session is be marked open (closed = False).
We want a functionthta Checks if user is actually in sessions. If not, it does nothing ,Decrements the user’s ref_count by 1  if it’s above 0 and If the resulting ref_count is now 0, set closed = True. Otherwise, set closed = False.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sessions is a dictionary where keys are user IDs and values are dictionaries with keys "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean), and user is a string representing a user ID.
def func_1(sessions, user):
    if (user not in sessions) :
        return sessions
        #The program returns `sessions`, which is a dictionary where keys are user IDs and values are dictionaries with keys "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean). The user ID represented by `user` is not a key in the `sessions` dictionary.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: sessions is a dictionary where keys are user IDs and values are dictionaries with keys "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean), and user is a string representing a user ID. The user is in sessions.
    session = sessions[user]
    if (session['ref_count'] == 0) :
        return sessions
        #The program returns the dictionary `sessions` where each key is a user ID and each value is a dictionary with keys "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean). For the specific user `user`, `session['ref_count']` is 0.
    else :
        if (session['ref_count'] == 1) :
            session['ref_count'] = 0
            session['closed'] = True
            return sessions
            #The program returns the dictionary `sessions` where each key is a user ID and each value is a dictionary with keys "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean). For the specific user `user`, `sessions[user]['ref_count']` is 0 and `sessions[user]['closed']` is True.
        else :
            session['ref_count'] = session['ref_count'] - 1
            session['closed'] = False
            return sessions
            #The program returns the `sessions` dictionary, where each key is a user ID and each value is a dictionary containing "ref_count" (an integer >= 0) and "closed" (a boolean). For the user ID stored in `user`, the corresponding session dictionary has `session['ref_count']` as a value greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, and `session['closed']` is `False`.

```


The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Return  True if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return False. if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
Remember to return just one word for your response.
