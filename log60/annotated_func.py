#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        return x + 1
        #The program returns x plus 1, where x is an integer greater than 0
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns x minus 1, where x is an integer less than or equal to 0
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `x + 1` if `x` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns `x - 1` if `x` is less than or equal to 0. There are no other edge cases or exceptions handled.
