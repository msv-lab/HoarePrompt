Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not compute the n-th Fibonacci number as required by the problem description. Instead, it returns `x + 1` if `x` is greater than 0 and `x - 1` if `x` is less than or equal to 0. This behavior is unrelated to the Fibonacci sequence, which is defined as follows: 

- Fibonacci(0) = 0
- Fibonacci(1) = 1
- Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) for n > 1

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
