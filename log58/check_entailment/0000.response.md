Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. Instead, it manipulates the input integer `x` based on its value: it increments `x` if it is greater than 0, decrements it if it is less than 0, and leaves it unchanged if it is equal to 0. This behavior does not align with the requirement to compute the n-th Fibonacci number, which involves a specific mathematical sequence. 

The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that:
- Fibonacci(0) = 0
- Fibonacci(1) = 1
- Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) for n > 1.

Since the program does not implement this logic or return Fibonacci numbers, it fails to meet the problem description requirements.
