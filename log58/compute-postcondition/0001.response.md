The value of `x` is incremented by 1, and since `x` is greater than 0, the new value of `x` will be greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0 and is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0 and is now increased by 1**
