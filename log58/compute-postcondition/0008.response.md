The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. If `x` is less than 0, the function returns `x` minus 1. If `x` is greater than 0, the function returns the value of `x` increased by 1. If `x` is equal to 0, the function returns the value of `x` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return `x` minus 1 if `x` is negative, `x` increased by 1 if `x` is positive, or `x` unchanged if `x` is zero. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns x minus 1 if x is less than 0; returns x increased by 1 if x is greater than 0; returns x unchanged if x is equal to 0.**
