You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: a function that normalizes a list of numbers so that they sum to 1. 
Python Fucntion:
```
def normalize(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return [x / total for x in numbers]
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
