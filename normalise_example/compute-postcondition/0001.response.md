Example Answer:
The code calculates the ratio of each number in the list to the total sum of all numbers in the list. The list 'numbers' contains the numbers, and 'total' is the sum of all numbers in the list. After executing the code, a new list is created with each element being the result of dividing the corresponding element in the 'numbers' list by the 'total' sum. The original variables 'numbers' and 'total' remain unchanged.
Output State: **numbers is a list of numbers, total is the sum of all numbers in the list, and the function returns a new list containing the ratios of each number to the total sum**
