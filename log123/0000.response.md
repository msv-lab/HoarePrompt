Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It checks if the `amount` is less than or equal to the current balance of Account A. If so, it subtracts the amount from Account A and adds it to Account B. If Account A does not have enough funds, it transfers the entire balance of Account A to Account B and sets Account A's balance to 0. This covers all potential cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all scenarios.
