Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number. However, the given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers and calculates the sum of all positive integers within that list. 

There are several reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function does not compute the n-th Fibonacci number. Instead, it sums positive integers from a list. This is a completely different operation.

2. **Inputs and Outputs**: The problem description suggests that the function should receive a single integer `n` (where `n` is the index of the Fibonacci number to compute) and return the corresponding Fibonacci number. The provided function takes a list of integers and returns a sum, which does not align with the requirements.

3. **Missing Logic for Fibonacci Calculation**: The logic to compute Fibonacci numbers (e.g., using recursion, iteration, or memoization) is not present in the program.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description regarding the computation of Fibonacci numbers.
