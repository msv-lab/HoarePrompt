According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will execute for each integer in `numbers`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is 0, which means either `num` was less than or equal to 0, or it was the first iteration where `total` was not updated. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least one more integer left to iterate over. Since the value of `num` is not specified in the given state, we cannot know the exact value of `num` at the next iteration, but we need to focus on the conditions to continue iterating.

Assuming `numbers` does have at least one more integer that hasn't been iterated over, we simply need to ensure that `total` can potentially be updated if that next integer is greater than 0.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that we are considering the next integer in the list to iterate over.

State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` has at least one more integer, `num` is the next integer in the list**
