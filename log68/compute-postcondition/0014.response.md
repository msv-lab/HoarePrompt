The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of integers, and all integers in the list should be non-negative. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of all positive integers in the list `numbers`, represented by the variable `total`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of non-negative integers `numbers` and return the sum of all positive integers in that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `numbers` and returns the sum of all positive integers in that list.**
