To analyze the loop and determine the final output state, we consider the provided initial state and code of the loop. The loop iterates through each integer in the list `numbers`, adding only the positive integers to `total`. 

If `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, `total` will be the sum of all those positive integers after the loop finishes executing. If `numbers` contains no positive integers, `total` will remain 0. 

Given the nature of the loop, the final output state is dependent on the contents of `numbers`. The following conclusions can be drawn:

1. If `numbers` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0.
2. If `numbers` contains positive integers, `total` will equal the sum of all positive integers in the list.
3. If `numbers` contains only negative integers or zero, `total` will remain 0.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`total` is the sum of all positive integers in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers.**
