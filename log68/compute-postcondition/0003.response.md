`total` is incremented by `num`. Given that `total` is initially 0 and `num` is the first integer in the list (which is greater than 0), `total` will be updated to the value of `num`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is now equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, and `num` is the first integer in that list.

Output State: **`total` is now equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, `num` is the first integer in that list**
