The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `num`, which is the second integer in the list `numbers`. Since `total` is initially 0, after the execution, `total` will equal `num`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `num` (the second integer in the list), `numbers` is a list of integers, and `num` is the second integer in that list.

Output State: **`total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, `num` is the second integer in that list**
