According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it relies on the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first integer in the list `numbers`. 

If the loop is to execute one more time, `num` must change to the next integer in the `numbers` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` refers to the second integer in the list. Additionally, the `total` will only change if `num` is greater than 0. Since the previous state indicates that `total` is 0, it implies either `num` is 0 or negative, or it was the first positive integer. 

Thus, to prepare for the next iteration:
- `num` needs to be the second integer in `numbers`.
- `total` will remain 0 unless the second integer is greater than 0.

State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list.**
