According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list contains at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is 0. For the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 integer, and `num` should be the first integer in the list.

State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list**
