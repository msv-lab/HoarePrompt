`total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The initial value of `total` is 0, and `num` is the third integer in the list `numbers`, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, after the execution, `total` will be equal to `0 + num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`total` is `num`, where `num` is the third integer in the list; `index` is 2, and `numbers` contains at least 3 elements.**
