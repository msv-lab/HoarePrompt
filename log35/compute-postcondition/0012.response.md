Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The values of `numbers`, `num`, and `total` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer, `total` is the sum of the previous total value and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer, `total` is the sum of the previous total value and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1**
