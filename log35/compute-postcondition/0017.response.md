Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, which means `total` increases by the value of `num`. The values of `numbers` and `count` remain unchanged unless `num` was part of `numbers`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers without the last element, `num` is the removed integer, `total` is updated based on the value of `num`, and `count` may or may not have been updated.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers without the last element, `num` is the removed integer, `total` is updated based on the value of `num`, and `count` may or may not have been updated**
