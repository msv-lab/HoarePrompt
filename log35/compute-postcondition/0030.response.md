Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates over the elements in `numbers`, summing up the elements that are greater than 1 and counting them. If none of the elements in `numbers` are greater than 1, the function returns None. After the loop, it calculates the average of the elements that are greater than 1 and returns that value. If `numbers` is empty, all elements are less than or equal to 1, or no elements are greater than 1, the function returns 0.
