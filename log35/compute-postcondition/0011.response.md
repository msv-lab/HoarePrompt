Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to `total`. The list `numbers` has the last element removed, and `num` is that removed element. After the addition, the new `total` value is the sum of the previous `total` value and `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer, `total` is the sum of the previous total value and `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer, `total` is the sum of the previous total value and `num`**
