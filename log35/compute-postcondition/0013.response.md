Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped, with the value of `num` being the removed integer from the list `numbers`. The state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer**
