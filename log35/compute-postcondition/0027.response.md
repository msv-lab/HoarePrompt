Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, if `numbers` list is not empty and contains elements greater than 1, then `average` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 divided by the count of such elements, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, then `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `numbers` is initially empty, `average`, `total`, and `count` remain 0. If `count` is 0, the program returns None.***
