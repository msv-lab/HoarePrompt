Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers without the last element, `num` is the removed integer. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In either case, the state of the variables `total` and `count` may or may not have been altered based on the value of `num`.***
