Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to the variable `num`. Since the list `numbers` has the last element removed, it now contains one less element. The value removed is stored in `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and it is not empty, `num` is the removed integer**
