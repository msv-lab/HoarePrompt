Postcondition: ***After not entering the if condition and entering the else block, if `count` is not equal to 0, then `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0, and `count` remains the same as before. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0.***
