Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. The value of `num` is now the last element of the list, and that element is removed from the list `numbers`. The variables `total` and `count` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list**
