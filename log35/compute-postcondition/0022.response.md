Output State: **After the loop executes, if `numbers` list is not empty, then `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, then `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0.**
