Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code iterates over the elements in the `numbers` list, summing up the elements that are greater than 1 and counting them. 
- If none of the elements in `numbers` are greater than 1, the function returns None as expected.
- After the loop, it calculates the average of the elements that are greater than 1 and returns that value.
- If `numbers` is empty, all elements are less than or equal to 1, or no elements are greater than 1, the function returns 0 as per the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
