According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is updated, `curr` is updated. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `prev` is updated, `curr` is updated**
