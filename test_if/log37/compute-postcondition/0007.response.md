Example Answer:
`prev` and `curr` are updated where `prev` takes the value of the previous `curr` and `curr` takes the value of the previous `prev` multiplied by the previous `curr`. The initial values of `prev` and `curr` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `prev` and `curr` are updated.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `prev` and `curr` are updated**
