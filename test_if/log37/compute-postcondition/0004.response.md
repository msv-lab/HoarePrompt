According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, n being a non-negative integer does not guarantee the loop will execute, so adjustments need to be made. To ensure the loop executes, n must be at least 2 and i is 2 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
