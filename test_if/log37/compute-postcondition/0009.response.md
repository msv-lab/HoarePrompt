Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`. Since the initial state mentions that `curr` is updated, we can assume it is the updated value. Therefore, after execution, `prev` will have the updated value of `curr`, and `curr` will have the product of the previous values of `prev` and `curr`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is updated, `curr` is updated**
