According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `prev` and `curr` are updated**
