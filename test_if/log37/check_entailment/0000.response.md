Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly calculate the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem description. The code is intended to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, but the current implementation calculates the product of all numbers from 2 to n instead. This is evident from the line `(prev, curr) = (curr, prev * curr)` where the product of `prev` and `curr` is calculated instead of the sum required for the Fibonacci sequence.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the output hints do not agree with the code.
