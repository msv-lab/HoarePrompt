You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Find the sum of the elements in the list that are larger than 0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list of integers.
def func_1(input_list):
    total_sum = 0
    while input_list:
        element = input_list.pop()
        
        if element > 0:
            total_sum += element
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `input_list` is empty, `total_sum` is the sum of all positive integers from the original `input_list`.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is the sum of all positive integers from the original input_list, where input_list is empty and thus total_sum is 0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
