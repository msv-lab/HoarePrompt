The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `element` to it. Given that `total_sum` was equal to the previous value plus `element`, after the execution, `total_sum` will now be equal to its previous value plus the value of `element` again (essentially doubling the contribution of `element` in this context). The other variables `input_list` and `element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input_list` has at least one integer, `element` is the last integer from `input_list`, `total_sum` is equal to the previous value plus 2 times `element`.**
