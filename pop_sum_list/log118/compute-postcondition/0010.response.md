According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `input_list`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `input_list` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `input_list` has at least one integer remaining, so it can execute one more time without any adjustments needed. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `element` is already a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` is correctly calculated as the previous value plus `element`.

State: **`input_list` has at least one integer remaining, `element` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` is equal to the previous value plus `element`.**
