The code `element = input_list.pop()` removes the last element from `input_list` and assigns it to `element`. Since `input_list` must contain at least one integer, after the execution, `input_list` will contain one less integer than it did initially. The variable `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`input_list` contains at least one integer less than before, `total_sum` is 0, `element` is the last integer from the original `input_list`.**
