The code `element = input_list.pop()` removes the last element from `input_list` and assigns that value to `element`. Since `input_list` must have at least one integer remaining, after popping, `input_list` will still contain integers. The variable `element` will now hold the last integer from the list, which is still a positive integer greater than 0, as stated in the initial conditions.

The output state will reflect the updated values of the variables affected by the code execution. 

Output State: **`input_list` has at least one integer remaining; `total_sum` is equal to `element`, and `element` is a positive integer greater than 0, now equal to the last integer popped from `input_list`.**
