`total_sum` is incremented by the value of `element`. Since `element` is a positive integer greater than 0, the new value of `total_sum` will be the previous value of `total_sum` plus `element`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`input_list` has at least one integer remaining; `total_sum` is equal to the previous value plus `element`, where `element` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
