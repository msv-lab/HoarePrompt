The code updates `total_sum` by adding the value of `element` to it. The initial state indicates that `total_sum` is currently 0 and `element` is a positive integer greater than 0. Therefore, `total_sum` will now be equal to the value of `element`.

Output State: **`input_list` contains at least one integer less than before, `total_sum` is equal to `element`, `element` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
