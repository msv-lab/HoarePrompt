Using simple annotated entailment
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should find the average of the positive integers in a list. Instead, the given code snippet defines a function `func_1()` that calculates the sum of the first five non-negative integers (0 through 4) and prints the running total at each iteration of the loop. 

Here are the key issues:
1. The function does not accept any input parameters, so it cannot process a list of numbers as required by the problem description.
2. The function calculates the sum of the first five non-negative integers, which is not related to finding the average of positive integers in a list.
3. The function does not compute or return the average of any positive integers.

To correctly implement the described functionality, the function should:
- Accept a list of integers as input.
- Filter out non-positive integers.
- Calculate the average of the remaining positive integers.
- Return or print the calculated average.

Since the provided program does not perform these steps, it fails to meet the problem description, hence the output is `False`.

 #State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters.
def func_1():
    total = 0
    for i in range(5):
        total += i
        
        print('Running total:', total)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is 5
