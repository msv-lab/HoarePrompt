#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, which may contain both zero and non-zero values.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        x += 1
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns a list of integers that are all less than or equal to -1, as each element in list 'x' is decreased by 1.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: The program returns a list of integers that are all less than or equal to -1, as each element in list 'x' is decreased by 1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is a list of integers, which may contain both zero and non-zero values. At least one element of `x` is greater than 0, but the operation `x += 1` is invalid.
    return x
    #The program returns the list of integers 'x' which contains both zero and non-zero values, and at least one element is greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `x`. If `x` is greater than 0 (which will always raise an error since `x` is a list), it returns the list unchanged. If `x` contains all elements less than or equal to -1, it will attempt to return a list where each element is decreased by 1, but this operation is not implemented correctly as the return statement in the else block subtracts 1 from `x`, which is invalid for a list. Thus, the function will always return the original list `x` regardless of its contents. Therefore, it effectively returns the original list `x` without modification, as the intended behavior for lists is not correctly implemented.
