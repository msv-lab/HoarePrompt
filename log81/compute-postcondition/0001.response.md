The operation `x += 1` attempts to add 1 to the list `x`. However, adding an integer to a list directly is not valid in Python. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change. The output state reflects that no alteration occurred, but the operation itself is invalid. 

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers, which may contain both zero and non-zero values. At least one element of `x` is greater than 0, but the operation `x += 1` is invalid.**
