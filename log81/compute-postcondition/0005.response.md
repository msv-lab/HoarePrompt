The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a list of integers, which may contain both zero and non-zero values. After executing the function body, if every element in the list `x` is less than or equal to -1, the function returns a new list where each element in `x` has been decreased by 1. If the list `x` contains both zero and non-zero values, and at least one element is greater than 0, the function returns the original list `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `x`, and based on the conditions of the elements in the list, either return a modified list with each integer decreased by 1 or return the original list `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `x` and returns a list where each element is decreased by 1 if all elements are less than or equal to -1; otherwise, it returns the original list `x` if it contains at least one element greater than 0.**
