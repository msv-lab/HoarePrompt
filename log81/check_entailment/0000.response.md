Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description requires the function to calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in a list and to reset the product whenever a zero is encountered.

However, the provided program does not perform any of these operations. Instead, it checks if the input list `x` has elements greater than 0 and tries to increment the list (which is invalid for a list in Python). The use of `return x - 1` within the else block is also incorrect as it attempts to subtract 1 from the entire list, which does not adhere to the intended functionality.

In summary, the program does not calculate the cumulative product, does not handle zeros correctly, and contains invalid operations for list manipulation. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
