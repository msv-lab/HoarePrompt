You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in the list. If a 0 is encountered, then add the product so far and start again.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, which may contain both zero and non-zero values.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        x += 1
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns a list of integers that are all less than or equal to -1, as each element in list 'x' is decreased by 1.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: The program returns a list of integers that are all less than or equal to -1, as each element in list 'x' is decreased by 1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is a list of integers, which may contain both zero and non-zero values. At least one element of `x` is greater than 0, but the operation `x += 1` is invalid.
    return x
    #The program returns the list of integers 'x' which contains both zero and non-zero values, and at least one element is greater than 0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
