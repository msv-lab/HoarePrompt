You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: implement a function computing the n-th Fibonacci's number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_1(x):
    if (x > 0) :
        x += 1
    else :
        if (x == 0) :
            x = 10
        else :
            if (x < -10) :
                x -= 10
            else :
                x = 0
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is an integer and less than 0. If `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in `x` being less than -20. If `x` is greater than or equal to -10, the execution leads to a contradiction as `x` cannot be both less than or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to -10. Hence, in the valid case, `x` will always be less than -10 after execution.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is an integer and less than or equal to 0. If `x` is 0, then `x` is set to 10. If `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in `x` being less than -20. If `x` is greater than or equal to -10 but less than 0, the execution leads to a contradiction, and thus `x` will be set to 0. This ensures that after execution, `x` will either be 10 (if it was originally 0), less than -20 (if it was less than -10), or 0 (if it was in the range -10 to -1).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is increased by 1. If `x` is 0, then `x` is set to 10. If `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in `x` being less than -20. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (inclusive of -1), then `x` is set to 0. Thus, after execution, `x` will be either greater than 1 (if it started greater than 0), equal to 10 (if it started at 0), less than -20 (if it started less than -10), or exactly 0 (if it started between -10 and 0).
    return x
    #The program returns a value for x which is either greater than 1 (if it started greater than 0), equal to 10 (if it started at 0), less than -20 (if it started less than -10), or exactly 0 (if it started between -10 and 0)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
