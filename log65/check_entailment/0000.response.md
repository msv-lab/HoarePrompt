Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which is to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. Instead, the program manipulates the integer `x` based on a series of conditional statements without any relation to Fibonacci numbers. 

Specifically, the function `func_1(x)` performs the following operations:
- If `x` is greater than 0, it increments `x` by 1.
- If `x` is 0, it sets `x` to 10.
- If `x` is less than -10, it decreases `x` by 10, making it less than -20.
- For values of `x` between -10 and 0 (inclusive of -1), it sets `x` to 0.

None of these operations compute the Fibonacci number at position `x`. The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Therefore, the function does not implement the required Fibonacci computation, leading to its inaccuracy concerning the problem description. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the task specified in the problem statement.
