Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer and less than or equal to 0. If `x` is 0, then `x` is set to 10. If `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in `x` being less than -20. If `x` is greater than or equal to -10 but less than 0, the execution leads to a contradiction, and thus `x` will be set to 0. This ensures that after execution, `x` will either be 10 (if it was originally 0), less than -20 (if it was less than -10), or 0 (if it was in the range -10 to -1).***
