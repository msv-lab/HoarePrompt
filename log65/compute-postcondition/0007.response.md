`x` is decremented by 10. Given that `x` is less than -10, the new value of `x` will be less than -20. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0, `x` is less than 0, `x` is less than -10; `x` is now less than -20.

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, `x` is less than 0, `x` is less than -10; `x` is now less than -20**
