Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is increased by 1. If `x` is 0, then `x` is set to 10. If `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in `x` being less than -20. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (inclusive of -1), then `x` is set to 0. Thus, after execution, `x` will be either greater than 1 (if it started greater than 0), equal to 10 (if it started at 0), less than -20 (if it started less than -10), or exactly 0 (if it started between -10 and 0).***
