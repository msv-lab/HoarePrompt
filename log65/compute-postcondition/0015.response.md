Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and modifies it based on the following rules: If `x` is greater than 0, it returns `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to 0, it returns 10. If `x` is less than -10, it returns `x - 10`, resulting in a value less than -20. If `x` is between -10 and 0 (inclusive), it returns 0. Therefore, the function returns a value greater than 1 for positive `x`, 10 for `x` equal to 0, a value less than -20 for `x` less than -10, and 0 for `x` in the range [-10, 0).**
