The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function returns different values based on the initial value of `x`: 

- If `x` is greater than 0, it returns a value greater than 1.
- If `x` is equal to 0, it returns a value equal to 10.
- If `x` is less than -10, it returns a value less than -20.
- If `x` is between -10 and 0 (exclusive), it returns exactly 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a specific value based on the range in which `x` falls. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns a value greater than 1 if x is greater than 0, returns 10 if x is 0, returns a value less than -20 if x is less than -10, and returns 0 if x is between -10 and 0.**
