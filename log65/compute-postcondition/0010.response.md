Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer and less than 0. If `x` is less than -10, then `x` is decreased by 10, resulting in `x` being less than -20. If `x` is greater than or equal to -10, the execution leads to a contradiction as `x` cannot be both less than or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to -10. Hence, in the valid case, `x` will always be less than -10 after execution.***
