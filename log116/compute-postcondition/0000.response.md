The value of `n` is assigned the length of `matrix`, which represents the number of rows (or columns, since it is a square matrix) in the matrix. Since `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n, `n` will reflect this dimension. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n; `n` is the length of `matrix`, which is a positive integer.**
