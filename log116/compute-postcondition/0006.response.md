The value of `total` is incremented by `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is currently 1. Since `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n, `matrix[1][1]` will be added to `total`. The previous value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`. 

After executing the code, the updated value of `total` will be `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is still greater than 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration if it were to continue.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n; `n` is greater than 1; `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]; `i` is 1**
