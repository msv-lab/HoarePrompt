The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón, where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, it returns the total, which is equal to the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the square matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix `matrix` and return the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix, which is a 2D list representing a square matrix, and returns the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix.**
