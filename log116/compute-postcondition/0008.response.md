According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1, making `i` equal to 2. To allow for this next iteration, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón; `n` must be greater than 2; `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]; `i` is 2**
