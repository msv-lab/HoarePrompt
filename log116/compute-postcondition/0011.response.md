To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the given code and the relationship between the variables.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the size of the square matrix. During each iteration `i`, it adds the values from two positions in the matrix to the `total`: the diagonal element `matrix[i][i]` and the anti-diagonal element `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. 

After the loop executes:

- The `total` will be the sum of all the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements in the `matrix`.
- Since the `matrix` is a square matrix of dimensions `n × n`, the loop will execute `n` times if `n` is greater than 0.
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0.

Now, let's summarize the output state after all iterations:

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n; `n` is a positive integer; `total` is equal to the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of `matrix`; `i` is `n - 1`.**
