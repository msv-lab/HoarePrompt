According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 since `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón; `n` must be greater than 1; `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`; `i` is 1**
