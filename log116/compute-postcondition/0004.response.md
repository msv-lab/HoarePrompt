The variable `total` is updated by adding the value from `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to its current value. The value of `total` is initially equal to `matrix[0][0]`, and since `i` is 0, the value being added is `matrix[0][n - 1]`. Therefore, the new value of `total` becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`; `i` is 0**
