The value of `total` is initially calculated as `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`. The code then adds the value from the matrix at the position `[i][n - i - 1]` to `total`. Given that `i` is 1, this means it will add `matrix[1][n - 2]` to `total`. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 2` is valid as `i` can range from `0` to `n-1`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n; `n` is greater than 1; `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n×n; `n` is greater than 1; `total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]; `i` is 1.**
