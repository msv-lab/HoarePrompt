Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to address the following scenarios:

1. The program does not verify whether the input matrix is actually a square matrix. If a non-square matrix is provided, the function will either raise an error or return incorrect results.

2. The program does not handle the case where the input matrix is empty. An empty matrix should ideally return a sum of 0, but the function will raise an error due to attempts to access elements.

3. The sum calculation logic incorrectly adds the center element twice when the matrix has an odd dimension (e.g., in the case of a 3x3 matrix, the center element `5` is added from both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal).

In summary, the program has multiple edge cases that it does not manage correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in those scenarios.
