The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a square matrix of dimensions n√ón, where n is a positive integer, and returns the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. It does not handle cases where the input is not a square matrix or when the matrix is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
