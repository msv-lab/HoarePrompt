To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the components:

### Problem Description
The function `matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix)` is supposed to calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, ensuring that no element of the matrix is added twice.

### Program Code
```python
import math
print(func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The code correctly initializes the total sum to 0 and iterates through the indices of the matrix.
2. It adds the elements from the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the anti-diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`).
3. However, it does not account for the center element of the matrix in the case of an odd-sized matrix, which will be counted twice (e.g., in a 3x3 matrix, the element `5` is counted in both diagonals).

### Edge Case
- For an odd-sized matrix (like the 3x3 case), the center element is included in both diagonal sums, leading to double counting. For example, with the matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the correct sum should be `1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25`, but the program will calculate `1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 27`.

### Output Hints
The output hints indicate that the function returns the sum of all elements along both diagonals but highlights that the center element is counted twice for odd-sized matrices, thus resulting in a sum that is greater than expected.

### Comparison of Code and Output Hints
The output hints align with the behavior of the code. They confirm that the function does not handle the case of odd-sized matrices correctly due to the double counting of the center element. Therefore, the hints corroborate the identified issue in the code.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description correctly in all cases (specifically, for odd-sized matrices), leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
