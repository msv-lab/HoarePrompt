The variable `total` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as the code only affects the variable `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in the matrix (i.e., `n` is equal to `len(matrix)`), `total` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in the matrix (i.e., `n` is equal to `len(matrix}`), `total` is 0**.
