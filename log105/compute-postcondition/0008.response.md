According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2**
