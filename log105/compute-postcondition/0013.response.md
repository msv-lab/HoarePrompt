The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of integers, where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. After executing the function body, it returns `total`, which is equal to the sum of all elements along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the square matrix `matrix`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of integers and return the sum of all elements on both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix, which is a square matrix of integers, and returns the sum of all elements along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.**
