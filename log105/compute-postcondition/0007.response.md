The code updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is currently 1, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 2`. The initial value of `total` is defined as `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `total` becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`. 

The variable `i` is not changed by the code, so it remains 1. The value of `n` is still greater than 1, as per the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 1**
