The variable `n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, which gives the number of rows in the square matrix. Since `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. Therefore, `n` is equal to the length of either dimension of the matrix. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in the matrix (i.e., `n` is equal to `len(matrix)`).**
