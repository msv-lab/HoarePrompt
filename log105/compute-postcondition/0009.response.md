The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][i]` to it. The value of `i` is equal to 2, so `matrix[i][i]` is equal to `matrix[2][2]`. Other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 still holds. 

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2**
