To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1(matrix)` based on the problem description.

The function is intended to calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, ensuring that no element is counted twice. 

Let's breakdown the function:

1. It calculates the size of the matrix `n` using `len(matrix)`.
2. It initializes a variable `total` to accumulate the sum.
3. It loops through the range of `n`, and in each iteration:
   - It adds the element from the primary diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`).
   - It adds the element from the secondary diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`).

The potential issue arises if the matrix size is odd. In such cases, the center element of the matrix is included in both the primary and secondary diagonal sums. For example, in a 3x3 matrix:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The diagonals are:
- Primary: 1, 5, 9 (sum = 15)
- Secondary: 3, 5, 7 (sum = 15)

The center element `5` is counted twice. The function will return `30`, which is incorrect as per the requirement that no element should be added twice.

Thus, we can identify a specific case where the function does not work correctly:

**Case**: For the input matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the expected result should be `15` (1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7, but counting 5 only once), while the function will return `30`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**
