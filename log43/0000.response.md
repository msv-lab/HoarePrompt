Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value of `counter`. As `counter` is an integer greater than 0, the value of `total` will increase by the value of `counter`. Therefore, the Output State is: counter is an integer greater than 0, total is the previous total value plus the counter value.
Output State: **counter is an integer greater than 0, total is the previous total value plus the counter value**
