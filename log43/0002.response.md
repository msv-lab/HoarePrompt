According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `counter`. If `counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `counter` is an integer greater than 0 (one less than its initial value), so for the loop to execute one more time, `counter` should be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **counter is an integer greater than 1, total is the previous total value plus the counter value**
