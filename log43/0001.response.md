Example Answer:
The value of `counter` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state states that `counter` is an integer greater than 0, after the execution `counter` will be one less than its initial value. The `total` variable is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: counter is an integer greater than 0 (one less than its initial value), total is the previous total value plus the counter value.
Output State: **counter is an integer greater than 0 (one less than its initial value), total is the previous total value plus the counter value**
