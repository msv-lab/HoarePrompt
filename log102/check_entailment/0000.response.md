Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, and returning this sum modulo `998244353`. Instead, the program contains two functions, `func_1` and `is_prime`, which are focused on counting prime numbers between `2` and `n-1`. 

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The program does not attempt to sum numbers in the range `[l, r]` based on the conditions of having at most `k` different digits. Instead, it counts prime numbers, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Inputs**: The `func_1` function is called with a single argument `10`, which is not aligned with the expected input of three integers (`l`, `r`, and `k`). The values for `l`, `r`, and `k` must be passed to the function to perform the correct operation as described.

3. **Missing Implementation of Key Logic**: There is no logic in the program to check for the number of different digits in the numbers between `l` and `r`, nor is there any calculation for the sum of those qualifying numbers. 

In summary, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, as it completely disregards the task of summing numbers based on their digit composition and instead focuses on counting primes, which is irrelevant.
