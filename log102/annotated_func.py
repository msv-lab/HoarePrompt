#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where `n` must be greater than 2) and returns the count of prime numbers in the range from 2 to `n-1`. It does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2, which may lead to incorrect behavior if such inputs are provided.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` and returns `True` if `num` is a prime number (greater than or equal to 2); otherwise, it returns `False`. The function accurately checks for primality by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. Edge cases include returning `False` for any integer less than 2.
