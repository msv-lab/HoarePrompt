According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. The value of `num` is at least 9, and since `num` is not divisible by 2, we need to check the value of `int(num ** 0.5)`.

1. Since `num` is at least 9, `int(num ** 0.5)` will be at least 3 (specifically, when `num` is 9, `int(num ** 0.5)` is 3).
2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 4. 
3. We need to ensure that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, we can summarize that for the loop to execute again, `num` must be at least 16 (since the square root of 16 is 4). 

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an integer and must be at least 16, `i` is 4, and `num` is not divisible by 2.**
