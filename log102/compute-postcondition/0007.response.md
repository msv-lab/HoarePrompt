According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. The loop's range starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `num` is not divisible by 2 and must be at least 4, we know that `int(num ** 0.5)` will be a value greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 3. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is 2, for the next iteration, `i` will be 3, and `num` must still allow `int(num ** 0.5)` to be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the conditions for the states are:
- `i` is now 3.
- `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 3, which implies `num` must be at least 9 (since \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \)).

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an integer and must be at least 9, `i` is 3, and `num` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 != 0)`**
