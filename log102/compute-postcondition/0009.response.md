Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an integer and must be at least 9, `i` is 3, and `num` is not divisible by 2. If `num` is divisible by `i` (which is 3), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
