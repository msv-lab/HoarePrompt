According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `num` must be at least 2, and `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 2, which means `num` should be at least 4. 

Since `num` is given to be greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that it is at least 4 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 2.

So for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `num` should be at least 4, and `i` should be initialized at 2.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` must be at least 4, and `i` is 2**
