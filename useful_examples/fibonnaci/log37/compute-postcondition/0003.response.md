Example Answer: 
The variables `prev` and `curr` are assigned the values 0 and 1 respectively. Since the variable `n` is not affected by the code, the value of `n` remains the same as the initial state, which is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer**
