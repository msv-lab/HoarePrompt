According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n where n must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
