The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer. The function calculates the sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix, which includes elements at positions `matrix[i][i]` and `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` for all `i` from 0 to n-1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list `matrix` representing a square matrix and return the total sum of its diagonal elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list matrix representing a square matrix and returns the total sum of all diagonal elements.**
