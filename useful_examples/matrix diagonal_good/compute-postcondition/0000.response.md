The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the `matrix`, which is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n. Since `matrix` is square, the value of `n` will be a positive integer, specifically equal to the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(matrix)`**.
