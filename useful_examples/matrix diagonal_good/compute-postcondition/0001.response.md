`total` is assigned the value `0`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state remains unchanged for the `matrix`, but now includes the value of `total`. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(matrix)`; `total` is 0.**
