The line of code `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]` updates the value of `total` by adding the value from the matrix at the position `[i][n - i - 1]`. The variable `i` is currently `0`, so this will access the first row of the matrix and the last column (since `n - 0 - 1` equals `n - 1`).

Given that `total` is initially equal to `matrix[0][0]`, we can infer:

- `matrix[0][0]` is the initial value of `total`.
- After the operation, `total` will now be equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated value of `total`.

Output State: **`total` is equal to `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix of dimensions n x n where n must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
