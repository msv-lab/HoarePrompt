Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a square matrix as input and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements correctly. The annotations provided also align with the problem description and clarify the behavior of the code. The code handles the case where the input matrix is empty (n=0) and returns 0 as the total sum, as required by the problem description. Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the annotations are consistent with the code logic, the correctness of the code is True.
