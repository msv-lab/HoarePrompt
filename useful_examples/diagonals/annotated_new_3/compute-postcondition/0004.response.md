Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value at the diagonal position of the current row and column, which is `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The variable `i` is 0, so `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, the value at the diagonal position is added to `total`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 0**
