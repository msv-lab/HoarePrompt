Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the element at position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, the position accessed will be `matrix[2][n - 2 - 1]`, which corresponds to the diagonal element opposite to the main diagonal. The value of `total` is updated based on this diagonal element. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 2**
