The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer. Each element of the matrix is a number. The function updates the variable `total` based on the diagonal elements of the square matrix. The variable `i` is used as a loop counter and is at least 0. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to update `total` based on the diagonal elements of the square matrix, while handling the case where n is 0.
