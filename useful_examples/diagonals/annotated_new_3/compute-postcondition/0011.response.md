According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 2. This means that the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 3**
