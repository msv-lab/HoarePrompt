According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated based on the diagonal element, `i` is 1**
