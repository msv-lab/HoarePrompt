According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 2**
