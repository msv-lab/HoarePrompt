Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(matrix)` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function iterates over the rows of the matrix, adding the elements at the current row and column index (`matrix[i][i]`) and the element at the current row and the mirrored column index (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum. This approach ensures that each element along both diagonals is added exactly once to the total sum.

The function assumes that the input matrix is a square matrix (i.e., the number of rows is equal to the number of columns), which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. If the input matrix is not square, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results, but this is not a concern given the problem statement.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
