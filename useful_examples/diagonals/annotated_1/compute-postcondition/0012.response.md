Output State: **After the loop executes, `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements and anti-diagonal elements of the square matrix. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute and `total` will remain 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will update `total` accordingly. `i` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches `n`.**
