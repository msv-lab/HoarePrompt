According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` needs to be greater than or equal to `i+1` to ensure the loop can run again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`**
