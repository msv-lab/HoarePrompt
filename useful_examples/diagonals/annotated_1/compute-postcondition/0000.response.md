Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n. Therefore, the value of `n` is equal to the number of rows/columns in the square matrix. The state of the matrix itself remains unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the number of rows/columns in the square matrix**
