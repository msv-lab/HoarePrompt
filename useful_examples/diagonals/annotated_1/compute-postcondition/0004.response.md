Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Since `i` is 0, the expression becomes `matrix[0][n - 1]`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, so the expression represents the element at the last column of the first row in the `matrix`. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is updated, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
