Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix to the previous value of `total`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1` remains true. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and the value of the element in the 2nd row and last column of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`**
