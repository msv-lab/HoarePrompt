According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be updated to `i` is 1.
State: **`total` is updated, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
