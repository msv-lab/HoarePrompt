Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function that takes a square 2D list of integers and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements and anti-diagonal elements. It iterates through the rows and columns of the square matrix, adding the elements at the diagonal and anti-diagonal positions. The code considers all potential cases, including when the matrix is empty (n=0) and when the matrix has a size greater than 0. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the code, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the code does not cover. Therefore, based on the problem description, code annotations, and logic of the code, the program is correct.
