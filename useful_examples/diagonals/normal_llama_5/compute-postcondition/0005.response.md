To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given code and state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Additionally, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, which is the sum of the first and last elements of the first row of the matrix. If the loop executes one more time, `i` will be 1, and `total` will be updated to include the first and last elements of the second row of the matrix. However, we don't need to update `total` at this point, as it will be updated in the loop body.

The state of `matrix` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

* `i` needs to be incremented by 1
* `n` needs to be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1)

The updated state is:

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]**
