The code `n = len(matrix)` assigns the length of the `matrix` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists, the length of `matrix` is equal to the number of inner lists, which is also equal to the length of each inner list.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is the length of `matrix` (which is also the length of each inner list)**
