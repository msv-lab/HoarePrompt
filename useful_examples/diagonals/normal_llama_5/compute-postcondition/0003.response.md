To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
total += matrix[i][i]
```
Given the initial state:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists
- `n` is greater than 0
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 0

Since `i` is 0, `matrix[i][i]` refers to the element at the first row and first column of the `matrix`. Let's denote the value of this element as `matrix[0][0]`.

The code increments `total` by the value of `matrix[0][0]`. Therefore, the new value of `total` is `0 + matrix[0][0]`, which simplifies to `matrix[0][0]`.

The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.

The output state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists
- `n` is greater than 0
- `total` is `matrix[0][0]`
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0**
