According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, and `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than n+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix, `i` is less than n+1**
