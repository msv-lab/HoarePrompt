Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix `matrix`, which is a square matrix of integers. The value of `n` will be the same as the number of rows or columns in the matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer**
