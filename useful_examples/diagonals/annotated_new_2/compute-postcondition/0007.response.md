Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal position is added to `total`, where `i` is used to access the diagonal elements in the matrix. The value of `i` is less than `n`, which ensures that the diagonal elements are within the matrix bounds. After execution, the sum of the diagonal elements is updated in `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, and `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with dimensions n x n where n is at least 1, and `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements of the matrix**
