To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and initial state.


Initial State: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, i.e., `len(matrix) == len(matrix[0])`.


Now, let's think step by step:


1. The code `n = len(matrix)` assigns the length of the `matrix` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `len(matrix)` will give the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.


2. The value of `n` will be equal to the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.


Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.


Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix**
