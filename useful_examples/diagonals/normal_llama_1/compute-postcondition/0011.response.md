To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Currently, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented, and `n` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, the new state should be:

* `i` is 3 (incremented from 2)
* `n` is greater than 3 (to ensure the loop can execute again)

The other variables, `matrix` and `total`, do not affect the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 2 rows (or columns), `n` is greater than 3, `total` is the old value of `total` plus the integer at the 2nd row and (`n - 3`)th column of the `matrix`, `i` is 3**
