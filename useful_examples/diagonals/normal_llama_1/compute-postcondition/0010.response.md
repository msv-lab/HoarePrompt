To calculate the output state, we'll analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 2 rows (or columns).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `total` is the old value of `total` plus the integer at the 2nd row and 2nd column of the `matrix`.
- `i` is 2.

Given Code:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `total` is updated by adding the integer at the position specified by `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

Calculating the Result:
- Since `i` is 2, `n - i - 1` equals `n - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.
- Therefore, `total` is updated by adding the integer at the 2nd row (`i` is 2, which is the 3rd index but we use 2 for calculation) and (`n - 3`)th column of the `matrix`.

Output State:
- `matrix` remains the same as it was not modified.
- `n` remains the same as it was not modified.
- `total` is updated to be the old value of `total` plus the integer at the 2nd row and (`n - 3`)th column of the `matrix`.
- `i` remains 2 as it was not modified.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 2 rows (or columns), `n` is at least 2, `total` is the old value of `total` plus the integer at the 2nd row and (`n - 3`)th column of the `matrix`, `i` is 2**
