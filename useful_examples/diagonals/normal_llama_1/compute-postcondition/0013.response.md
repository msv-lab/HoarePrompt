The function returns `total`, and `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the `matrix`. The values of `matrix` and `n` do not change, so the output state is `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the `matrix`, `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the `matrix`, and the function returns `total`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the `matrix`, `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the `matrix`, and the function returns `total`**
