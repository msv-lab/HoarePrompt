The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `matrix[i][i]` is the integer at the second row and second column of the `matrix`. The value of `total` was the sum of the integers at the first row and first column and the first row and last column of the `matrix`, and now it is increased by the integer at the second row and second column of the `matrix`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 2 rows (or columns), `n` is at least 2, `total` is the sum of the integers at the first row and first column, the first row and last column, and the second row and second column of the `matrix`, `i` is 1**
