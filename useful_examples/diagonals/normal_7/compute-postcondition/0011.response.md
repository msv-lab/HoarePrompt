According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 2**
