Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `i` is 0. After the calculation, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, and `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 0**
