Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at the index `[i][i]` of the matrix. The value of `i` is 1, so the value at index `[1][1]` of the matrix is added to `total`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been further updated, `i` is 1**
