Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is 0. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but the values of `matrix` and `i` are not provided, so the exact value of `total` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been updated, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` has been updated, `i` is 0**
