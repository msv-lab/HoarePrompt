Example Answer:
The code adds the value of the diagonal element at index i to the total. Since the matrix is a square matrix with dimensions ((n+1) x (n+1)), the diagonal elements are at index [0][0], [1][1], [2][2], ..., [n][n]. Therefore, the total is incremented by the sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix. The previous value of total is unknown. 
Output State: **total is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix**
