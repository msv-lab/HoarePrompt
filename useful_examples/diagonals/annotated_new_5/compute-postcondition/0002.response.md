According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the total is 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `total` is 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0**
