Example Answer:
The variable `total` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix, `total` is 0.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix, `total` is 0**
