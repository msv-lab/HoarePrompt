Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly computes the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix as described in the problem statement. It iterates over the diagonal elements of the matrix and accumulates their sum in the variable `total`. The annotations also confirm that the code handles square matrices of any size and computes the sum of diagonal elements accurately. Since there are no examples or cases provided where the code does not work as expected, and the annotations align with the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
