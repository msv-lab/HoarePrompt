According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the matrix is a square matrix of side length `n`, and `total` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the state should be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 at the beginning of the loop.
State: **matrix is a square matrix of side length `n`, `total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
