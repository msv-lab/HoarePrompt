Output State: **If n is at least 1, the loop will execute and update the total by adding the values at positions (0, n-1) and (i, n-i-1) for each iteration. After the loop, total will contain the sum of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and total will remain 0.**
