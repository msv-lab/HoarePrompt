Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix, which is a square matrix of size n x n. Therefore, the value of `n` is equal to the side length of the square matrix. The output state is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the side length of the square matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the side length of the square matrix**
