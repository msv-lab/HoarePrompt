Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix)` that correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. It iterates through the elements of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix and adds them to the total. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the purpose of the function and how it calculates the sum. The code aligns with the problem description, and there are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
