Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(matrix)` correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. Here's why:

* The function first determines the size of the matrix `n` by getting the length of the matrix.
* It then initializes a variable `total` to store the sum of the diagonal elements.
* The function uses a single loop to iterate over the rows of the matrix. In each iteration, it adds the element at the current row and column `i` (i.e., `matrix[i][i]`) to the `total`. This covers the primary diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).
* Additionally, it adds the element at the current row and column `n - i - 1` (i.e., `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the `total`. This covers the secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).
* After the loop completes, the function returns the `total`, which is the sum of all elements along both diagonals.

This approach is correct because it visits each element on both diagonals exactly once, without adding any element twice. The loop only iterates `n` times, where `n` is the size of the matrix, which is sufficient to cover all elements on both diagonals.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
