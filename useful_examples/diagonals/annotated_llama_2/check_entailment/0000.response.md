Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix of any dimension n√ón. However, the code does not handle the case where the matrix is not square. The annotations mention that if the matrix is not square, it will raise an `IndexError`. This is not in line with the problem description, which does not specify what should happen in this case. The code should either handle non-square matrices or explicitly state that it only works for square matrices.

The annotations were helpful in understanding the code, but they also highlighted this issue. The annotations mention that the function will raise an `IndexError` if the matrix is not square, which made me realize that this case is not handled according to the problem description.

To fix this issue, the code should either add a check to ensure that the matrix is square before calculating the sum, or it should explicitly state that it only works for square matrices. For example:

```python
def matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix):
    if len(matrix)!= len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("Matrix is not square")
    # rest of the code
```

Alternatively, the problem description could be updated to specify what should happen in the case of a non-square matrix.
