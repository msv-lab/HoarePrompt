To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `total` is the initial value based on `matrix[2][0]`, `matrix[2][n - 1]`, `matrix[2][1]`, and `matrix[2][n - 2]`, plus `matrix[2][2]`, plus `matrix[2][n - 3]`.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently 2 and `n` is greater than 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to increment by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Thus, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

The state of `matrix` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted based on the loop statement provided. However, the calculation of `total` suggests a dependency on the values within `matrix`, but without the loop body, we cannot accurately adjust `total`. Given the information, we focus on the loop condition.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
