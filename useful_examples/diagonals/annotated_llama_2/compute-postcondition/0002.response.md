To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop valid. 

The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is at least 1. 

Given the initial state: 
- `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers
- `n` is the length of the inner lists of the matrix
- `total` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. 

- `n` must be greater than 0, as the loop will not execute if `n` is 0.
- Since `n` is the length of the inner lists of the matrix, and the matrix is a square 2D list, `n` should also be the number of inner lists in the matrix.
- `i` should be initialized to 0, as it will be the first value in the range of `n`.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
