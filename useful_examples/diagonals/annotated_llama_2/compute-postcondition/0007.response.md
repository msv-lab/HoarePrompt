The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The initial value of `total` is `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1] + matrix[1][1]`, and `i` is 1. The value of `n` is greater than 1, but its exact value is unknown.

When `i` is 1, `n - i - 1` equals `n - 2`. Therefore, the value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]`.

The output state is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `total` is `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `total` is `matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`.**
