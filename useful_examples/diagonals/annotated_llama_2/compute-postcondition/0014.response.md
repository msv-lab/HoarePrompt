The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers, i.e., a list of lists where all inner lists have the same length as the outer list, and this length is a positive integer.

After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases:

Case 1: If the size of the matrix (`n`) is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Case 2: If the size of the matrix (`n`) is 0, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square 2D list of integers `matrix` and return the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix size is greater than 0, or 0 if the matrix size is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers `matrix`, returns the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix size is greater than 0, or 0 if the matrix size is 0.**
