`total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Given `i` is 2, `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[2][n - 2 - 1]`, which is `matrix[2][n - 3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `total` is the initial value based on `matrix[2][0]`, `matrix[2][n - 1]`, `matrix[2][1]`, and `matrix[2][n - 2]`, plus `matrix[2][2]`, plus `matrix[2][n - 3]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `total` is the initial value based on `matrix[2][0]`, `matrix[2][n - 1]`, `matrix[2][1]`, and `matrix[2][n - 2]`, plus `matrix[2][2]`, plus `matrix[2][n - 3]`.**
