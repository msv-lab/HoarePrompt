The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. Since `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[0][n - 1]`. The initial value of `total` is `matrix[0][0]`, so the new value of `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 inner list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`.**
