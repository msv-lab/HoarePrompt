To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, since `n` is the determining factor for the loop's continuation, its relation to `i` needs to be maintained in a way that ensures the loop can execute again. Given `n` is greater than 0, it should remain so, but specifically, it needs to be greater than the new value of `i`, which will be 1.

The state of `matrix` and the calculation of `total` do not directly affect the loop's condition (`i` in `range(n)`), so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is 1 (since it needs to be incremented from 0 to continue the loop).
- `n` is greater than 1 (to ensure the loop condition is met for `i` being 1).

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list representing a square matrix, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.**
