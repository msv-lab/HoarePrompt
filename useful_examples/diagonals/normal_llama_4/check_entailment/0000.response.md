Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1(matrix)` calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, which is what the problem description asks for.

However, I do notice that the code does not check if the input matrix is indeed square. If the input matrix is not square, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results.

The output hints agree with the code, and they also mention that the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results if the input matrix is not square. This suggests that the code does not handle this edge case.

Therefore, I conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when the input matrix is not square.

Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when the input matrix is not square, which is a valid input according to the problem description. The function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results in this case, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
