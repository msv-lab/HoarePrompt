Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by iterating through the rows of the matrix. The code adds the element at index `[i][i]` (main diagonal) and the element at index `[i][n - i - 1]` (anti-diagonal) to the total sum. However, this approach does not ensure that no element of the matrix is added twice. For example, in a 3x3 matrix:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```
The code will add the elements 1, 5, 9, 3, 5, 7 to the total sum, resulting in counting the element at index `[1][1]` (5) twice. This violates the problem description, hence the code is incorrect.
