Example Answer: 
The loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix in a zigzag pattern and updates the total accordingly. If the matrix is empty (n=0), the loop does not execute and the total remains 0. The function returns the total value calculated by the loop. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is total is the sum of the diagonal elements in the zigzag pattern of the square matrix.
Output State: **total is the sum of the diagonal elements in the zigzag pattern of the square matrix**
