According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Since it's specified that the matrix is a square matrix (n x n), the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `total` is 0, so no adjustment is needed for `total`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
