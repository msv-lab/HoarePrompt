Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the value of the element at the diagonal of the matrix, which is `matrix[i][i]`. Since `i` is 0 initially, the element at the diagonal of the matrix is `matrix[0][0]`. Therefore, `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[0][0]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is the value of matrix[0][0], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
