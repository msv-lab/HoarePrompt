Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix `n x n`, so `n` will be the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer; `n` is the length of the matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer; `n` is the length of the matrix**
