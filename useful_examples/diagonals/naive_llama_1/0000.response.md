Correctness: **True**.

I believe the program is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. Here's why:

1. The program first determines the dimension of the matrix (`n`) by taking the length of the matrix.
2. It then initializes a variable `total` to store the sum of the diagonal elements.
3. The program uses a single loop to iterate over the rows of the matrix. For each row `i`, it adds the element at position `(i, i)` (the primary diagonal) and the element at position `(i, n - i - 1)` (the secondary diagonal) to the `total` sum.
4. This process is repeated for all rows, effectively summing all elements along both diagonals.
5. Finally, the program returns the total sum.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work correctly. The loop iterates over all rows, and the indexing is correct for both diagonals. The program also handles the case where the matrix is a single element (1x1) correctly, as well as larger square matrices.

Overall, the program is concise, efficient, and accurate, making it correct according to the problem description.
