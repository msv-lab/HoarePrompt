Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(matrix)` that correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the rows of the matrix and adds the elements at the corresponding positions of the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal to the total sum. The annotations also confirm that the function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements, including both the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal, and returns the correct total sum. 

I have reviewed the code, the annotations, and the problem description and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
