Example Answer: 
The value at index (i, i) of the matrix is added to the total. As i is 0 initially, the value at index (0, 0) of the matrix is added to total. Therefore, the total is updated with the value at index (0, 0) of the matrix. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is updated with the value at index (0, 0) of the matrix, `i` is 0**
