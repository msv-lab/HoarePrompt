Example Answer:
The value at position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is added to the `total` value. The value of `i` is less than `n+1`, so it iterates through the rows of the matrix. After execution, the `total` value is updated by adding the value at position `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` for each row. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, updated `total` value, `i` is less than `n+1**.
