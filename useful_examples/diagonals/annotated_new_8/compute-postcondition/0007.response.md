Example Answer:
The value at index (0, 0) is added to the value at index (0, n - 1) and the sum of values at diagonal elements up to index i, then assigned to `total`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The new value `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is added to `total`. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `total` is updated with the new total value, `i` is incremented by 1**
