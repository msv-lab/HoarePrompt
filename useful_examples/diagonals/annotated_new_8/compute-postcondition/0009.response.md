Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the element at index `[i][i]` from the `matrix`. The value of `i` is less than `n+1`, so it is within the bounds of the matrix. After this operation, the new value of `total` is calculated based on the previous value and the element at index `[i][i]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, updated `total` value, `i` is less than `n+1**
