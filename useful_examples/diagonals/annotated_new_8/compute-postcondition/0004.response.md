Example Answer:
The value at index (0, 0) of the matrix is added to `total`, and the value is taken from index (0, n - 1). Since `i` is 0, the value at index (0, n - 1) is added to `total`. The output state is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is updated with the value at index (0, 0) + matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is updated with the value at index (0, 0) + matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 0**
