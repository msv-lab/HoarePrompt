According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is the side length of the square matrix. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `total` is updated with the value at index (0, 0) + matrix[0][n - 1], `i` is 1**
