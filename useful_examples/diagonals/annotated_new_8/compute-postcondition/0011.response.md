According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, updated `total` value, `i` is less than `n+1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n+2`.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, updated `total` value, `i` is less than `n+2`**
