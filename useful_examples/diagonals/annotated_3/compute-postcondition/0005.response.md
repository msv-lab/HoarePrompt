According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, `i` is less than `n+1`**
