According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix + `matrix[n][n]`, `i` is equal to `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to `n+1` and `total` should be updated to include the new diagonal element `matrix[n+1][n+1]`.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n+1 x n+1), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix + `matrix[n+1][n+1]`, `i` is equal to `n+1`**
