Example Answer: 
The variable `total` is initialized to 0. Since no operation is performed on the matrix or any other variable, the output state is simply `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix, and `total` is 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix, `total` is 0**
