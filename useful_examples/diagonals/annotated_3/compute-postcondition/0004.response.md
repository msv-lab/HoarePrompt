Example Answer: 
The code adds the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to the current value of `total`. This means that the element at the position `(i, n - i - 1)` in the matrix is added to the total. Since this code is within a loop iterating over `i`, it will sum the diagonal elements of the matrix. The previous value of `total` represents the sum of the diagonal elements before this operation. Therefore, after running the code, the total will be updated to include the sum of the new diagonal element.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix**
