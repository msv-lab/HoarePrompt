Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][i]`, which corresponds to the diagonal elements of the square matrix. The previous value of `total` is 0 and the matrix is a square matrix of size n x n. After execution, the value of `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix**
