According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, `i` is less than `n+1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n`, as the loop condition is `i < n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, `i` is equal to `n`**
