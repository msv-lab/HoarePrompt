According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Since `matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, it implies that `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `total` is 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, to guarantee the loop execution, the state should be adjusted to `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, and `total` is 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0**
