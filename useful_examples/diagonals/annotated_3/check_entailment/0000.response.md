Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix)` that correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function iterates over the rows of the matrix and adds the diagonal elements to the total, ensuring that no element is added twice. The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the program, stating that the sum will be 0 if the matrix is empty or not a square matrix. Additionally, the annotations mention that the loop will iterate through the rows and add the diagonal elements to the total, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the code and annotations are in agreement with the problem description and there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
