Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. As `matrix` is a square matrix, the new `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`**
