Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute for the diagonal elements of the square matrix. The loop will sum the elements on the diagonal and its reverse diagonal up to the ith index. After the loop executes, `total` will be the sum of these diagonal elements, `i` will be equal to n, and `n` will be equal to the dimension of the square matrix. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and `total` will remain 0.**
