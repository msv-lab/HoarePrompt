The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of dimension n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. If n is greater than 0, the function will sum the elements on the diagonal and its reverse diagonal up to the ith index. After the loop executes, `total` will be the sum of these diagonal elements, `i` will be equal to n, and `n` will be equal to the dimension of the square matrix. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and `total` will remain 0. The function returns the value of `total`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of dimension n x n and return the sum of diagonal elements up to the ith index, considering both the diagonal and reverse diagonal. If n is 0, the function returns 0.
