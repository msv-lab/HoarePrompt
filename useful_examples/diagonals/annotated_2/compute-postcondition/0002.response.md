According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `total` being 0 does not affect the execution of the loop. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n where n is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be set to 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n where n is a non-negative integer and n is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
