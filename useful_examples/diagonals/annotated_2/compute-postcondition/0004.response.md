Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `n` is the dimension of the square matrix. The variable `i` is increased by 1. The output state is: `matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n where n is a non-negative integer and n is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n where n is a non-negative integer and n is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1**
