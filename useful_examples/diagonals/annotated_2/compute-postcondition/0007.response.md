Example Answer:
The variable `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The output state is: `matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of dimension n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to the (i+1)th index, `i` is increased by 1**
