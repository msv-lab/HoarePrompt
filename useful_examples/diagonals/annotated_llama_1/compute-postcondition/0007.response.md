The value of `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The initial value of `total` is the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`. The value of `i` is 1. 

`matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is `matrix[1][n - 1 - 1]`, which is `matrix[1][n - 2]`. Therefore, the value of `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 1**
