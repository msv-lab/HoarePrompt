The code assigns the value of `len(matrix)` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists, `len(matrix)` will return the number of rows in the matrix, which is equal to the number of columns in each row.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`.**
