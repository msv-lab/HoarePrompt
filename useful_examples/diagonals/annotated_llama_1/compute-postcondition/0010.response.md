To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables.

The code `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]` increments the value of `total` by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. 

Since `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1, we can calculate `n - i - 1` as `n - 2 - 1` which is `n - 3`.

The value of `total` is incremented by the value at `matrix[2][n - 3]`.

The states of the other variables (`matrix`, `n`, `i`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]` plus the value at `matrix[2][2]` plus the value at `matrix[2][n - 3]`, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the initial total (0) plus the value at `matrix[0][0]` plus the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][1]` plus the value at `matrix[1][n - 2]` plus the value at `matrix[2][2]` plus the value at `matrix[2][n - 3]`, `i` is 2**
