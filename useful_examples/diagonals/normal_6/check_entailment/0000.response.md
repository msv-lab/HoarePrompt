Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided in the program seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a square matrix as input, iterates through the matrix, and calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of the matrix. It updates the total sum by adding the elements at the main diagonal (matrix[i][i]) and the secondary diagonal (matrix[i][n - i - 1]). The code ensures that no element is added twice since each element is only added once based on its position in the matrix. Additionally, if the input matrix has a dimension of 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and the total sum remains 0. 

The output hints also align with the code functionality, further confirming that the code accurately calculates the sum of elements along both diagonals of the square matrix. Since the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints support the correctness of the code, we can conclude that the code is correct.
