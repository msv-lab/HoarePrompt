Example Answer:
The value at position [1][1] in the matrix is added to `total`, and the values of `i` and `n` are used to access the correct index in the matrix. The previous state of `total` is unknown, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. After execution, `total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix and the values of `i` and `n`. 
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix**
