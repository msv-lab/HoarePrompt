Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the side of the square matrix `matrix`, which is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state is: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the length of the side of the square matrix**.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the length of the side of the square matrix**.
