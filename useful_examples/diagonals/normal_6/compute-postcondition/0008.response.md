According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value. 
State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**
