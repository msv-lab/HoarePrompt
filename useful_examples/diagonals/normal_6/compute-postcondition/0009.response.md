Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `total` is updated by adding the value at position [1][1] in the matrix to it. The value of `total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix. The value of `n` remains the same. 
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position [1][1] in the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**
