Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix` to the current value of `total`. The value of `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, so the calculation `n - i - 1` results in a valid index in the matrix. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is updated according to the new value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the new value at position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
