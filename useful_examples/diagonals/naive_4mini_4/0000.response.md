To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(matrix)`.

### Problem Description
The function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. It should ensure that no element is counted twice.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
    return total
```

### Breakdown of the Logic
1. The function first determines the size of the matrix `n` by using `len(matrix)`.
2. It initializes a variable `total` to zero.
3. It enters a loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).
4. In each iteration, it adds the element at the primary diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the secondary diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to `total`.
5. Finally, it returns the total.

### Potential Issues
The key problem here is that the function does not check if the two diagonals intersect, specifically in the case of matrices with odd dimensions. For example, in a `3x3` matrix:

```
[
 [1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]
]
```

- The primary diagonal contains: `1, 5, 9`
- The secondary diagonal contains: `3, 5, 7`

The element `5` is counted twice.

### Conclusion
Since there is at least one case (odd dimension matrices) where the program does not perform correctly, the correctness of the program is impacted.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does not correctly handle the requirement that no element of the matrix can be added twice when calculating the sum of the diagonals.
