To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(matrix)`.

**Problem Description:** The function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix without adding any element twice.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]          # Adds the primary diagonal
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]  # Adds the secondary diagonal
    return total
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Primary Diagonal:** The elements added from the primary diagonal are `matrix[i][i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Secondary Diagonal:** The elements added from the secondary diagonal are `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

### Potential Issue:
For an odd-dimensional matrix (e.g., 3x3), the center element (at index `[1][1]`) gets added twice â€“ once from the primary diagonal and once from the secondary diagonal.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the matrix:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```
- The primary diagonal elements are: `1, 5, 9` (sum = 15)
- The secondary diagonal elements are: `3, 5, 7` (sum = 15)
- The element `5` (center element) is counted twice.

So, the result calculated by the function will be:
```
Total = 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 30
```
However, it should only be:
```
Total = 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
```

### Conclusion:
The program improperly handles the case of odd-dimensional matrices by counting the center element twice. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement set by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
