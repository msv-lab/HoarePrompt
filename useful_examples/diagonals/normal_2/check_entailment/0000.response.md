Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of values at the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix by iterating through the rows of the matrix. However, the code does not handle cases where the input matrix is not square (n x n) or when n is negative. Additionally, the code is not correctly calculating the sum of all elements along both diagonals as per the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
