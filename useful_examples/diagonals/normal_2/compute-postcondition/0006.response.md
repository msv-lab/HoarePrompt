Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at index `[i][i]` of the `matrix` array. The value of `i` is 1, so the value at index `[1][1]` of the `matrix` array is added to `total`. The value of `n` does not affect this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated based on the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
