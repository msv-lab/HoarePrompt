Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array to itself. The value of `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `total` is updated based on the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array, `i` remains 0, and `n` remains greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at index [0][0] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
