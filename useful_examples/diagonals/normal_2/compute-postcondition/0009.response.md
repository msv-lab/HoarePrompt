Example Answer:
The value at index [i][n - i - 1] in the `matrix` array is added to `total`, where `i` is 2. The previous state of `total` and `matrix` is unknown, but `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. After execution, the new value of `total` will be updated based on the addition of matrix[2][2]. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated based on the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at index [2][2] in the `matrix` array, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
