The function accepts a square matrix `matrix` and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements by iterating through the rows and columns. If the loop executes, the total is updated with the sum of the diagonal elements. If the loop does not execute, the total remains unchanged. It does not handle cases where the matrix is not square or the elements are not numerical values.
