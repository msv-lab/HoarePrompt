Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function iterates through the rows and columns of the matrix, adding the elements at the main diagonal `matrix[i][i]` and the elements at the secondary diagonal `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to the total. However, this approach fails to accurately calculate the sum of elements along the diagonals. 

For example, consider the following 3x3 matrix:
```
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```
The correct sum of both diagonals should be 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 30. However, the code provided would calculate the sum as 1 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 20 since it is adding elements of the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal incorrectly.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, thus the correctness is **False**.
