According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. To execute one more time, the value of `i` should be increased by 1. 
State: **total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix, `i` is incremented by 1**
