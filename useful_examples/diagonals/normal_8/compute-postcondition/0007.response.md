Example Answer:
The value of total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. The diagonal elements are matrix[i][i] where i ranges from 0 to n. Since the matrix remains a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix.

Output State: total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix.
