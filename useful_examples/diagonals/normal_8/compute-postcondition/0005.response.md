According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` has been increased by the sum of diagonal elements of the square matrix, and the matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be increased by 1 to create a new square matrix of size (n+1) x (n+1) with new elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **matrix remains a square matrix ((n+1) x (n+1)), total is increased by the sum of diagonal elements of the new matrix**
