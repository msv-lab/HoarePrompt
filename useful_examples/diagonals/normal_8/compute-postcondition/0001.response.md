Example Answer:
The variable `total` is assigned the value of 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is the matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value.
Output State: **matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value**
