According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, which ensures the loop will execute. Hence, there is no need to adjust the state.
State: **matrix remains a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer greater than 0, and each element of the matrix is a numerical value**
