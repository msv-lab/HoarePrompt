Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix, where `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `total` and `i` are unknown, so after execution, the output state is: total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **total is increased by the sum of the diagonal elements of the new matrix, `i` is incremented by 1**
