Example Answer:
After executing the provided code snippet, the value of `total` is incremented by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is `n-2`, so it refers to the second last row in the matrix. Therefore, `total` is further incremented by the value of `matrix[n-2][n-1]` and `matrix[n-2][n-2]`. 
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix with the additional element at the last row and last column, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n-2, `total` is incremented by the value of matrix[i][n - i - 1], and `total` is further incremented by the value of matrix[i][i]**
