Example Answer:
The function returns the value of `total`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is at least 0, and the function returns 0.
Output State: **`total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is at least 0, and the function returns 0**
