Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, where `len()` returns the number of rows in the matrix, which is equal to the number of columns since the matrix is square. Therefore, the Output State is: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix**.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows/columns in the matrix**.
