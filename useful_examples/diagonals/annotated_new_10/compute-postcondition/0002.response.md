According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, and total is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer, total is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
