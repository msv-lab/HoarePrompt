According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n-1`.
State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n-1**
