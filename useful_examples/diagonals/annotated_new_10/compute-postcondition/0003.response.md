Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal of the square matrix `matrix` at index `i` is added to the `total`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the diagonal elements at index 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 will be added to `total`. The value of `total` will be the sum of the diagonal elements of the square matrix.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n**
