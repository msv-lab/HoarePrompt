According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the matrix is a square matrix n x n, it implies that n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, total is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
