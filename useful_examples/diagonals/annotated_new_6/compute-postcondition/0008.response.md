According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n), `total` is calculated based on certain diagonal elements, `i` is increased by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `total` needs to be updated to include the diagonal element at index (0, n - i - 1).
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated to include the diagonal element at index (0, n - i - 1), `i` is increased by 1**
