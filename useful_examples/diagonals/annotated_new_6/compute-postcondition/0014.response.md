The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. The `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, and each element of the matrix is a number. 

After executing the function body, if n is 0, the loop does not execute, and total remains 0. If n is greater than 0, the loop calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) and stores it in total. The function returns the total sum of the diagonal elements. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix `matrix` where n is a non-negative integer, calculate the sum of diagonal elements if n is greater than 0, and return the total sum.
