According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the size of the square matrix `matrix`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is the value of the diagonal element at index (0, 0) plus the value of the diagonal element at index (0, n-1), `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer, `total` is the value of the diagonal element at index (0, 0) plus the value of the diagonal element at index (0, n-1), `i` is 1**
