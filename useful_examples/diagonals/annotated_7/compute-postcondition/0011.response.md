According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `total` is updated according to the mentioned formula, `i` is incremented by 1**
