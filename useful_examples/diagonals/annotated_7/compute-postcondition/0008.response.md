According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0 plus `matrix[i][i]` plus `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to `i` is 2.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0 plus `matrix[2][2]` plus `matrix[2][n - 2 - 1]`, `i` is 2**
