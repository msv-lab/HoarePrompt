Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If n is greater than 0, the function correctly computes the sum of diagonal elements. However, the current code only considers the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal elements for summation. It does not cover scenarios where n is less than 0 or edge cases where n is even or odd, which may lead to unexpected behavior.**
