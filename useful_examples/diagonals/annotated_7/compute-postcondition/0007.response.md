Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `n` is not affected, but `total` is updated to include the new diagonal element. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0 plus `matrix[i][i]`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0 plus `matrix[i][i]` plus `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `i` is 1**
