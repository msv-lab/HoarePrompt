Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `matrix[0][n - 1]` is accessed. Since `matrix` is a square 2D list, `n` is the number of rows and columns, so `matrix[0][n - 1]` accesses the element at the last column of the first row. Therefore, the value of `total` is updated by adding this element. The updated `total` now represents the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers of dimension n x n, `n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `total` is the sum of the diagonal elements up to index 0, `i` is 0**
