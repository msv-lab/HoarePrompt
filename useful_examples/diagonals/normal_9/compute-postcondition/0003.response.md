Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value of the diagonal element at index i in the square matrix `matrix`. The initial value of `total` is 0. After executing the code, the `total` will be the sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer, `total` is the sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix**
