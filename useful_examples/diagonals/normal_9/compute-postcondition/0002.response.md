According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the matrix is a square matrix of size n x n implies that n is a positive integer. The total is 0 before the loop starts, which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the matrix is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer, `total` is 0**
