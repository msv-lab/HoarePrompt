According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is adjusted to `i+1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is `i+1`**
