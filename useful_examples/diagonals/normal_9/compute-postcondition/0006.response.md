Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal position `matrix[i][i]` is added to the `total` sum. The value of `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is adjusted to `i+1`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer, `total` is the updated sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix, `i` is adjusted to `i+1`**
