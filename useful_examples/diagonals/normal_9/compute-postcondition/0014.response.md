The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix of size n x n where n is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function calculates the sum of all diagonal elements in the matrix and stores it in a variable `total`. The variable `i` is adjusted after each iteration. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. The function returns the value of `total`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of size n x n, calculate the sum of diagonal elements, and return the total sum. If n is 0, the total sum returned is 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of size n x n, calculates the sum of diagonal elements, and returns the total sum. If n is 0, the total sum returned is 0.**
