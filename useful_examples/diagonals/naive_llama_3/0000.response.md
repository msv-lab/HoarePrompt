Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function `func_1(matrix)` iterates over the rows of the matrix, adding the elements at positions `(i, i)` and `(i, n - i - 1)` to the total sum. This effectively covers all elements on both diagonals without adding any element twice.

The program handles square matrices of any dimension `n√ón` correctly, as it uses the length of the matrix `n` to determine the indices of the diagonal elements. The loop iterates `n` times, ensuring that all diagonal elements are included in the sum.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
