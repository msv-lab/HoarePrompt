Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n. The value of `n` will be the side length of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is the side length of the square matrix**.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is the side length of the square matrix**
