According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix up to the new (i+1)th element, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1` as it is increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix up to the new (i+1)th element, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
