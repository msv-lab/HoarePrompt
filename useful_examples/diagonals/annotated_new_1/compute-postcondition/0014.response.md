The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer. If n is greater than 0, the function iterates over the diagonal elements of the square matrix and updates the total by adding the diagonal elements at current ith and (n - i - 1)th indices. After the loop executes, the total will be the sum of all diagonal elements, i will be n, and n will still be the side length of the square matrix. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and the total will remain 0. The function returns the total.
Functionality: **The function accepts a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer. It calculates the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix and returns the total sum.**
