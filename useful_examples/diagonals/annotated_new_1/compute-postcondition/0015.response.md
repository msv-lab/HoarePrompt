Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a positive integer. It calculates the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix and returns the total sum. The function correctly calculates the sum of diagonal elements, considering both main diagonal and secondary diagonal elements. However, it does not handle cases where the input matrix is not a square matrix (n x n). **
