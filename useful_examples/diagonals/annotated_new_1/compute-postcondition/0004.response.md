Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of the element at index `[i][n - i - 1]` of the `matrix`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The `total` is updated with the sum of the diagonal elements up to the new `i`th element. The `n` remains the same as it is the side length of the square matrix. 
Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is the updated sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix up to the new ith element, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
