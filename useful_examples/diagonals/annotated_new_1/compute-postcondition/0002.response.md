According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `total` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `n` is the side length of the square matrix, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
