Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `matrix[0][0]` is accessed. The value at that position is added to `total`. Since the initial state of `total` is 0, the value of `matrix[0][0]` is added to `total`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `total` is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
