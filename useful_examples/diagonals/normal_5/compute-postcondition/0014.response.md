The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer. Each element of the matrix is a valid integer. The function calculates the sum of the diagonal elements and the elements at the opposite end of the row in the matrix. It iterates through each row of the matrix, where `i` is the index of the current row being processed and `n` is the number of rows in the matrix. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and the function returns 0. The function ultimately returns the value of `total`, which is the sum of the specified elements in the matrix.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix where each element is an integer. It calculates the sum of diagonal elements and elements at the opposite end of the row. It returns the total sum based on the specified conditions for each row.**
