Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `len(matrix)`, where `len()` gives the number of rows in the matrix, which is equal to the number of columns since it's a square matrix. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer. Each element of the matrix is a valid integer; `n` is the number of rows/columns in the square matrix.**
Output State: **Precondition: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a non-negative integer. Each element of the matrix is a valid integer; `n` is the number of rows/columns in the square matrix.**
