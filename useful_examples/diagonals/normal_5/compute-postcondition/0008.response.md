According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 1 and less than `n`, the loop will execute again. The only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total` is updated based on the sum of the initial value and the element at the opposite end of the row, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
