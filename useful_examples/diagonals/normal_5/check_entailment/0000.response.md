Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the rows of the square matrix and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements and the elements at the opposite end of the row for each row. The total sum is then returned. Since the code handles each row of the matrix as specified in the problem description, and the output hints do not provide any conflicting information, we can conclude that the code is correct.
