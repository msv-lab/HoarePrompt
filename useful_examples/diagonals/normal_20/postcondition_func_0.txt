The function func_1 accepts a square matrix as input, calculates the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements, and returns the total sum. The function iterates through the matrix elements, adding the diagonal and anti-diagonal values to the total. If the input matrix is empty (n=0), the function returns 0 as the total sum.
