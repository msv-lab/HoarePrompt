Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at index `[i][i]` of the matrix. Since `i` is 2, the element at index `[2][2]` is added to `total`. The values of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
