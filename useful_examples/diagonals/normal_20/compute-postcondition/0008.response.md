According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1 and less than `n`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total` is updated based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
