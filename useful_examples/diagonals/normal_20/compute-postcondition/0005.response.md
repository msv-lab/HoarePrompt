According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` has been updated to a new value based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total` is updated to a new value based on the matrix elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
