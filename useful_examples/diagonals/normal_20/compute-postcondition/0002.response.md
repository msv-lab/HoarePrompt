According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Since it is a square matrix, the number of rows and columns must be the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be at least 1, `total` remains 0, and `i` starts at 0.
State: **`total` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
