The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square matrix where each element is a numeric value. The function returns the sum of the diagonal elements and anti-diagonal elements of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix as input and return the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix as input and returns the sum of its diagonal and anti-diagonal elements.**
