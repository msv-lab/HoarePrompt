To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is 0 plus the value of `matrix[0][0]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Given that `i` is 0, the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, the code adds the value of `matrix[0][n - 1]` to `total`.

Since `total` initially is 0 plus the value of `matrix[0][0]`, after the execution, `total` will be the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n - 1]`.**
