Based on the initial state, if `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix, and `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0.

The code `return total` returns the value of `total`. 

Therefore, the output state is: if `n` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and the function returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If `n` is 0, `n` is 0, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **if `n` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and the function returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. If `n` is 0, `n` is 0, and the function returns 0.**
