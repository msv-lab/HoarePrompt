Let's analyze the annotated code and return postconditions step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts a square matrix `matrix` as input. The annotations state that the matrix is a square matrix, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition. However, the code assumes that the matrix is square and uses the length of the matrix to iterate over its rows and columns.

The function initializes two variables: `n` to store the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, and `total` to store the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix.

The function then iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop, and for each row, it adds the element on the main diagonal and the element on the anti-diagonal to the `total` variable.

After the loop, the function returns the `total` variable, which represents the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the input matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop does not execute, and the function returns 0. This is consistent with the annotations.
* If the input matrix is not square, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception. However, the annotations assume that the matrix is square, and the code does not check for this condition.
* If the input matrix contains non-numeric elements, the function may raise an exception when trying to add the elements to the `total` variable.

Based on the code and annotations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square matrix of numbers and returns the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements if the matrix is non-empty, or 0 if the matrix is empty. However, if the input matrix is not square or contains non-numeric elements, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception. **
