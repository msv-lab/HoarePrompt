According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

The state of `total` is also related to the values of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is incremented to 1, `total` should be updated to include the sum of `matrix[1][0]` and `matrix[1][n - 1]`, in addition to the previous sum.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix[1][0]`, and `matrix[1][n - 1]`.**
