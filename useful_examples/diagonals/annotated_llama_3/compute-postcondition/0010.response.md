To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column)
- `n` is greater than 2
- `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]` counted three times, `[1][1]`, and `[2][2]` in the `matrix`
- `i` is 2

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The value of `i` is 2.
2. The expression `n - i - 1` is evaluated. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, `n - i - 1` equals `n - 3`.
3. The value at position `[i][n - i - 1]` in the `matrix` is `matrix[2][n - 3]`.
4. The value of `total` is incremented by the value at position `[2][n - 3]` in the `matrix`.

Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]` counted three times, `[1][1]`, `[2][2]`, and `[2][n - 3]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, `[1][n - 2]` counted three times, `[1][1]`, `[2][2]`, and `[2][n - 3]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 2**
