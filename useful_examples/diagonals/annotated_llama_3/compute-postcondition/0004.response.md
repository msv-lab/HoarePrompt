To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `total` is the value at the position `[0][0]` in the `matrix`.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Code to Execute**:
   ```
   total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
   ```

Given that `i` is 0, we substitute `i` with 0 in the code:
```
total += matrix[0][n - 0 - 1]
total += matrix[0][n - 1]
```

Since `total` initially is the value at `matrix[0][0]`, after the execution, `total` will be the sum of the value at `matrix[0][0]` and the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`.

**Output State**: **`matrix` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]` and `[0][n - 1]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 0.**
