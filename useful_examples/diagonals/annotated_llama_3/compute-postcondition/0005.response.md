To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop condition and the current state.


According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. However, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n` after the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 1.


Since `i` is now 1, we also need to consider the value of `total`. The value of `total` was calculated based on the previous value of `i`, which was 0. Now that `i` is 1, we need to adjust the value of `total` to be the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, and `[1][n - 1 - 1]` or `[1][n - 2]` in the `matrix`.


The state of `matrix` and `n` remains unchanged.


State: **`matrix` is a square matrix of integers with at least 1 row (and column), `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the values at positions `[0][0]`, `[0][n - 1]`, and `[1][n - 2]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1.**
