To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `i` is incremented to 1
* `n` is still greater than 0, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes again

The other states, `matrix` and `total`, do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top left and top right elements of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
