To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- The loop calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of a square matrix and stores it in `total`.
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes at least once and `total` will contain the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0.
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop executes.

Now, let's analyze the given code:
```
return total
```
The code simply returns the value of `total`.

Based on the initial state and the given code, we can conclude that:

- The value of `total` is not changed by the given code. It still contains the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.
- The function returns the value of `total`.
- The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by the given code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `total` contains the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.
- The function returns the value of `total`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, `i` is `n-1`, `total` contains the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix, and the function returns the value of `total`.**
