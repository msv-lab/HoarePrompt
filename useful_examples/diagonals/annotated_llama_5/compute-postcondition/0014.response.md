The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, where all inner lists have the same length as the outer list, and this length is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.**
