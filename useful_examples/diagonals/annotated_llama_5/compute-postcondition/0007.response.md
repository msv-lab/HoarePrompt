To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code `total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]` increments the value of `total` by the element at position `[i][n - i - 1]` in the `matrix`.

Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, we can calculate the position `[i][n - i - 1]` as `[1][n - 1 - 1]` which simplifies to `[1][n - 2]`.

Since `matrix` is a square list of lists, the row index `1` is valid, and the column index `n - 2` is also valid because `n` is greater than 1.

The initial state of `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, and second diagonal elements of `matrix`. Let's denote the top left element as `matrix[0][0]`, the top right element as `matrix[0][n - 1]`, and the second diagonal element as `matrix[1][n - 2]`.

The initial value of `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`.

After executing the code, the new value of `total` becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[1][n - 2]`.

Since `matrix[1][n - 2]` is added to `total` again, the new value of `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, second diagonal, and the element at position `[1][n - 2]` in the `matrix`.

The output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, second diagonal, and the element at position `[1][n - 2]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers with at least one row and one column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top left, top right, second diagonal, and the element at position `[1][n - 2]` in the `matrix`, `i` is 1**
