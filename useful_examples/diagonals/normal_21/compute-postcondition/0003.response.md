Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is 0. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, we have to assume that `matrix` is a valid 2D array with at least 1 row and column. Therefore, the value of `total` is updated based on the value at the first row and column of `matrix`. 
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value of `matrix[0][0]`**
