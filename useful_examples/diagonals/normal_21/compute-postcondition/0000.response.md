Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the length of the matrix `matrix`, which indicates the size of the square matrix. Since `matrix` is a square matrix with dimensions n x n, the value of `n` is the side length of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: matrix is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is the side length of the square matrix.
Output State: **Precondition: matrix is a square matrix (n x n), `n` is the side length of the square matrix**
