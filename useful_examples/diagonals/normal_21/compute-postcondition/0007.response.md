Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1, and `n` is adjusted accordingly. Since we do not have information on the initial values of `total`, `i`, and `n`, the final output state is dependent on the specific values present in the `matrix`. 
Output State: **The final state of `total`, `i`, and `n` will depend on the specific values in the `matrix`.**
