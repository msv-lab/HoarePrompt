Example Answer: 
`total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` where `i` iterates over a range. The previous value of `total` and the contents of `matrix` are unknown, so the final value of `total` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated based on the value of `matrix[0][0]`.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value of `matrix[0][0]`**
