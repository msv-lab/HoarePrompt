The function func_1 accepts a square matrix of size n x n, calculates the sum of diagonal elements by summing the elements along both the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal. It then returns the total sum of the diagonal elements. If the matrix is empty or n is 0, the function returns 0. The state of total, i, and n after execution will depend on the specific values stored in the matrix.
