To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented, and `n` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, the state adjustments are:

* `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
* `n` needs to be greater than 1.

The other variables, `matrix` and `total`, are not affected by the loop condition, so their states remain the same.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 1**
