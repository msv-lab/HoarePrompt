According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. Additionally, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is greater than 2, `total` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][n - 1] + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`, `i` is 2**
