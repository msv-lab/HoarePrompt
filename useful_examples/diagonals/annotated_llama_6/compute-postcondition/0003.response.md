To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `total` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
total += matrix[i][i]
```

The impact of this code on the program is that it adds the value at the position `[i][i]` in the `matrix` to the `total`. Since `i` is 0, it specifically adds the value at the position `[0][0]` in the `matrix` to the `total`.

Given that `total` is initially 0, the new value of `total` will be the value at `matrix[0][0]`.

The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `total` is `matrix[0][0]`.
- `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and column, `n` is at least 1, `total` is `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0**
