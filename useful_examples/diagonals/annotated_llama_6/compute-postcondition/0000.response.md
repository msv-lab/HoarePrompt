The code assigns the value of `len(matrix)` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers, `len(matrix)` will give the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Let's denote the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix as `x`. Then, the value of `n` will be `x`.

The state of the `matrix` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with `x` rows and columns, `n` is `x`.**
