The function returns `total`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `n` is either 0 or greater than 0, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with `n` rows and columns, `total` is either 0 or the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix, and the function returns `total`.

Output State: **`n` is either 0 or greater than 0, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with `n` rows and columns, `total` is either 0 or the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix, and the function returns `total`.**
