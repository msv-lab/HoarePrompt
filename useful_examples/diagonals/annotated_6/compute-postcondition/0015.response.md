Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a square 2D list of integers matrix with dimensions n x n, and calculates the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. If n is greater than 0, it returns the total sum of the diagonal elements. If n is 0 or negative, it returns 0. **

The code properly calculates the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix as described in the annotations. It handles the case where n is greater than 0 by summing the diagonal elements correctly. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where the input matrix is not a square matrix, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
