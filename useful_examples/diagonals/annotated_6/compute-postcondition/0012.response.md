Output State: 
If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update the total with the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. After the loop executes, total will contain the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix, and i will be n-1. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and total will remain 0.
**If n is greater than 0, total will be the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix. If n is 0 or negative, total will remain 0.**
