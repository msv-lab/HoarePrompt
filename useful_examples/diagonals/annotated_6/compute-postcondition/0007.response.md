Example Answer:
`total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. The value of `matrix[1][n - 2]` is calculated and added to `total`. The previous state of `total` was updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, and `matrix[1][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n-2]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n-2]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
