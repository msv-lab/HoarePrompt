Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. The new value of `total` will be the sum of the current `total` and `matrix[0][n-1]`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the updated value with the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is the updated value with the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
