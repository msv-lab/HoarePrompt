Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `matrix`, which is the number of rows or columns of the square matrix. Since `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers, `n` represents the dimensions of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the number of rows or columns of the square matrix.**
Output State: **Precondition: matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer; `n` is the number of rows or columns of the square matrix.**
