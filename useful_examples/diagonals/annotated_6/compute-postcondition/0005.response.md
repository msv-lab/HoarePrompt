According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the updated value with the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total` is the updated value with the sum of `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][n-1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
