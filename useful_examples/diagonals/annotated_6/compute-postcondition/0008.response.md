According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated with the sum of specific elements in the matrix, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 1, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`total` is updated with the sum of `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, and `matrix[1][n-2]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
