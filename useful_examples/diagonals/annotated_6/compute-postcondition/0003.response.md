Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][i]`. Since `i` is 0, the value of `matrix[0][0]` is added to `total`. The state of `n` is not affected and remains greater than 0. 
Output State: **`total` is updated with the value of `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
