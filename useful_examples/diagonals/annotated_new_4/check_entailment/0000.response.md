Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1(matrix)` that correctly calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the matrix diagonally, adding the values at `matrix[i][i]` and `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to the total. The function then returns the final total. The code annotations provide a clear explanation of how the function works and the potential scenarios it covers. Additionally, the provided code logic aligns with the problem description, ensuring that no element of the matrix is added twice. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
