Example Answer: 
The function returns the final value of `total`. The loop will execute `n` times, updating `total` by adding the values at `matrix[i][i]` and `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` after each iteration. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and `total` will remain 0. Therefore, the output state is: If n is greater than 0, the loop will update total based on the matrix values; If n is 0 or negative, total will remain 0.
Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will update total based on the matrix values; If n is 0 or negative, total will remain 0**
