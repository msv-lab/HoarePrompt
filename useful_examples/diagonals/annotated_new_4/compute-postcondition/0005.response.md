According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **total is the value at `matrix[0][n - 1]`, `i` is 1**
