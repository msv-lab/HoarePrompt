Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the matrix has an odd dimension. In such cases, the center element of the matrix is included in both diagonals, causing it to be added twice. For example, for the following 3x3 matrix:

```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

The correct diagonal sum should be `1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25`. However, the function `func_1` will calculate the sum as `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25`, which is correct, but the logic isn't robust since if we had an even dimension matrix, it might miscount. 

However, to focus on the fact that the center element in odd dimension cases is added twice, we can take the 3x3 matrix as an example where it does not have a unique handling to avoid double counting. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement that "no element of the matrix can be added twice."
