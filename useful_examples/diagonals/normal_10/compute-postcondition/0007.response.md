Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it, where `i` is 1. Therefore, `total` will be the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]` and `matrix[1][1]`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]` and `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1**
