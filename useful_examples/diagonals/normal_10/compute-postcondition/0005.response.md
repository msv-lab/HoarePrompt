According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the updated value after adding `matrix[1][n - 1]`, `i` is 1**
