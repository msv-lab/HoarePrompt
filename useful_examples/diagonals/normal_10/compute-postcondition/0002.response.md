According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `total` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
