Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by summing the elements at indices `[i][i]` and `[i][n - i - 1]` for each row `i`. However, the code does not correctly handle the case where there is an odd number of rows/columns in the matrix.

For example, consider a 3x3 matrix:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```
The sum of the elements along both diagonals should be 1+5+9+3+5+7 = 30. However, the code provided would calculate 1+5+9+3+5+7 = 30, missing the element at index `[1][1]`. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle cases where the matrix has an odd number of rows/columns.
