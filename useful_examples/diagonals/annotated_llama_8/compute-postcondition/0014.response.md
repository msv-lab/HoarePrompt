The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix, where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a square matrix and return the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix and returns the sum of its main diagonal and anti-diagonal elements.**
