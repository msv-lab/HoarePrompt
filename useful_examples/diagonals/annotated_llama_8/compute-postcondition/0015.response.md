The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix as input. According to the annotations, the function calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the square matrix.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the function does not handle the case where the input matrix is not a square matrix. If the input matrix is not square, the function will throw an `IndexError` when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0). In this case, the function will return 0, which is correct according to the annotations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of a square matrix, but it does not handle non-square matrices and assumes that the input matrix is a square matrix.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix, calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, and returns the sum. However, it assumes the input matrix is square and does not handle non-square matrices, which will result in an IndexError. If the input matrix is empty, it returns 0. **
