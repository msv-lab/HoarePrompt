The code adds the value of `matrix[i][i]` to `total`. Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][i]` is the value of the middle element of the first row of `matrix`. 

The initial value of `total` is the sum of the top-left and top-right elements of `matrix`. After the execution of the code, `total` is updated to include the value of the middle element of the first row of `matrix`.

The state of `matrix` and `n` remains unchanged. The state of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, and middle elements of the first row of `matrix`, `i` is 1**
