Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the matrix may be of any dimension n√ón, but the code does not handle non-square matrices. According to the annotations, the function assumes the input matrix is square and does not handle non-square matrices, which will result in an IndexError.

For example, if the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], which is a 2x3 matrix, the code will raise an IndexError when trying to access matrix[i][n - i - 1] because n is 2, but the matrix only has 3 columns.

The annotations were helpful in identifying this issue, as they explicitly state that the function assumes the input matrix is square and does not handle non-square matrices. This is a clear indication that the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases, specifically non-square matrices.
