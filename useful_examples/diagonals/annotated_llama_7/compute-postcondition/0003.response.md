To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state.

The initial state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0.

The code snippet is: `total += matrix[i][i]`

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The code accesses the element at the `i`-th row and `i`-th column of the `matrix` (since `i` is 0, it accesses the first row and first column).
2. The value of the accessed element is added to the `total`.
3. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation.
4. The value of `i` is not changed by this operation.

Since the specific value of the element at `matrix[0][0]` is not provided, we can only express the new value of `total` in terms of this unknown value. Let's denote the value of `matrix[0][0]` as `x`.

The new value of `total` is `0 + x = x`.

The output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the value of `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0**
