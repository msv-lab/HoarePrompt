Let's break down the information step by step:

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, meaning it is a 2D list where the number of rows equals the number of columns in each row, and all elements are integers.

Now, let's analyze the output:

There are two cases:

Case 1: If `n` is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix.

Case 2: If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.

Note that `n` is not a parameter of the function, but rather a variable that seems to be related to the size of the matrix. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, we can assume that `n` represents the number of rows (or columns) of the matrix.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square list of lists of integers `matrix` and return the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the matrix if the matrix is non-empty (i.e., `n` is greater than 0). If the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the function returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a square list of lists of integers `matrix`, returns the sum of all elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix is non-empty, otherwise returns 0.**
