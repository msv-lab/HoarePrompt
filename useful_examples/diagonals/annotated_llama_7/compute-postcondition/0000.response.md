The code assigns the value of `len(matrix)` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `len(matrix)` returns the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix**
