A new variable `total` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the existing variables `matrix` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`, and `total` is 0.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in `matrix`, and `total` is 0**
