The function returns `total`. If `n` is greater than 0, `total` will be the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of a square matrix, and `i` will be `n - 1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `total` will remain 0. The value of `matrix` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: if `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `matrix` remains unchanged, and the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of a square matrix; if `n` is 0, `i` is 0, `matrix` remains unchanged, and the function returns 0.
