To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, second diagonal elements, and twice the third diagonal element of `matrix`.
- `i` is 2.

Code Snippet:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Now, let's break down the code's impact:

1. The code accesses an element in the `matrix` using the indices `i` and `n - i - 1`.
2. Since `i` is 2, the expression `n - i - 1` becomes `n - 2 - 1 = n - 3`.
3. The accessed element is added to `total`.

Given that `total` initially includes the sum of specific diagonal elements and `i` is 2, the addition of `matrix[2][n - 3]` to `total` essentially adds another element from the matrix to this sum.

Output State:
- `matrix` remains unchanged as it's a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is still greater than 2.
- `total` is updated to include the sum of the top-left, top-right, second diagonal elements, twice the third diagonal element, and the element at `matrix[2][n - 3]` of `matrix`.
- `i` is still 2.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the top-left, top-right, second diagonal elements, twice the third diagonal element, and the element at `matrix[2][n - 3]` of `matrix`, `i` is 2**
