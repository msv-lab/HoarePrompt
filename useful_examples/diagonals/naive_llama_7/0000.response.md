Correctness: **True**.

I believe the program is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. The function `func_1(matrix)` iterates over the matrix using a single loop, adding the elements at the current position `i` along the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the anti-diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the total sum.

The program handles square matrices of any dimension `n√ón` correctly, and it does not add any element twice, as required by the problem description. The use of `n - i - 1` as the column index for the anti-diagonal ensures that the elements are correctly accessed and added to the sum.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the code seems to cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
