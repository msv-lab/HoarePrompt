Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a square 2D list of integers as input, calculates the sum of values at both diagonals of the matrix, and returns the total. The code correctly iterates through the matrix to sum the values at the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal without adding any element twice. The annotations provided give a clear explanation of what the code does, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the code fails to handle. Therefore, based on the problem description and the code provided, the program is correct.
