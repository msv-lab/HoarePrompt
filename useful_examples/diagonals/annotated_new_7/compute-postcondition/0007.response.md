Example Answer: 
`total` is updated by adding the value at the diagonal of the matrix at position `i` and `n - i - 1`. Variable `i` is then incremented by 1. Given that `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, the process continues. 
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`**
