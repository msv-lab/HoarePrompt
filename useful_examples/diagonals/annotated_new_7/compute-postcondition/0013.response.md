Example Answer:
The function returns `total`, which is updated based on the values at the diagonals of the matrix. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is updated based on the values at the diagonals of the matrix. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0.
Output State: **`total` is updated based on the values at the diagonals of the matrix. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `total` remains 0**
