According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 2, `n` is greater than the new value of `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be further incremented by 2, and `n` should be greater than the new value of `(i + 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `n` should be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`total` is updated based on the value at the diagonal of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 4, `n` is greater than `i + 3`**
