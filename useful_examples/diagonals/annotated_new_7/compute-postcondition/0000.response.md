Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the matrix, which is the number of rows in the square 2D list. Since the matrix is a square 2D list, the number of rows is equal to the number of columns (n x n). Therefore, the value of `n` represents the dimensions of the square matrix. 
Output State: **matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer**.
