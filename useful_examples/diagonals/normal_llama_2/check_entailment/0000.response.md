Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1(matrix)` calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix by iterating over the rows of the matrix and adding the elements at positions `[i][i]` and `[i][n - i - 1]` to the total sum.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the code does not check if the input matrix is indeed square or if it contains non-integer values. The problem description does not specify what should happen in these cases, but the output hints mention that the function's behavior is undefined in these cases.

After reading the output hints, I agree that they accurately describe the code's behavior. The hints mention that the function returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix is not empty, and that the function's behavior is undefined if the input matrix is not square or contains non-integer values.

Given this information, I conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the input matrix is not square or contains non-integer values.

Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly when the input matrix is not square. For example, if the input matrix is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, the code will throw an error when trying to access `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` because `n` is not defined. Similarly, if the input matrix contains non-integer values, the code will not handle this case correctly.
