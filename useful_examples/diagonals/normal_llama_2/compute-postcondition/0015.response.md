To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is expected to be a square list of lists of integers.
2. It calculates the length of the matrix (`n = len(matrix)`).
3. It initializes a variable `total` to 0.
4. The function then iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop.
5. Inside the loop, it adds the elements on the main diagonal (`matrix[i][i]`) and the anti-diagonal (`matrix[i][n - i - 1]`) to the `total`.
6. After the loop, it returns the `total`.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the input matrix is not square, the function may not work as expected. However, this case is not handled explicitly in the code.
* If the input matrix is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop does not execute, and the function returns 0. This is handled correctly in the code.
* If the input matrix contains non-integer values, the function may not work as expected. However, this case is not handled explicitly in the code.

Based on the code and the potential edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a square 2D list of integers and returns the sum of the elements on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal if the matrix is not empty; otherwise, it returns 0. However, if the input matrix is not square or contains non-integer values, the function's behavior is undefined. **
