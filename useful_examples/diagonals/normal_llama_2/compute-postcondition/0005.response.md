To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is: `for i in range(n):`

This indicates that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers
- `n` is at least 1
- `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist and the nth element of the first sublist in `matrix`
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop condition `i < n` is still satisfied.

The state of `matrix` and the calculation of `total` do not directly impact the loop's execution condition, which is based solely on the values of `i` and `n`. Therefore, these states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is at least 2, `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist and the nth element of the first sublist in `matrix`, `i` is 1**
