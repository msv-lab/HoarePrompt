To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist, the nth element of the first sublist, and the element at the second row and second column in `matrix`.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Now, let's think step by step:
- `i` is 1, so `n - i - 1` is `n - 2`.
- `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` is the element at the second row (`i` is 1, and list indices start at 0) and the `(n-1)`th column in `matrix`.
- The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `matrix` is still a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is still at least 2.
- `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]`.
- `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is at least 2, `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]`, `i` is 1**
