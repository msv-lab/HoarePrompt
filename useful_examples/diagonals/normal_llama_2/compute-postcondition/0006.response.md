To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist and the nth element of the first sublist in `matrix`.
- `i` is 1.

The given code is:
```python
total += matrix[i][i]
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The value of `i` is 1.
2. `matrix[i][i]` refers to the element at the second row and second column of the `matrix` (since indexing starts at 0).
3. The value of `matrix[i][i]` is added to `total`.

Since the initial value of `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist and the nth element of the first sublist in `matrix`, and `i` is 1, the new value of `total` will be the sum of the first element of the first sublist, the nth element of the first sublist, and the element at the second row and second column of the `matrix`.

The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is at least 2, `total` is the sum of the first element of the first sublist, the nth element of the first sublist, and the element at the second row and second column in `matrix`, `i` is 1**
