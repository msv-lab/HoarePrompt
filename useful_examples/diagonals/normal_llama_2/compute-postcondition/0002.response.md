To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which is the length of `matrix`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, because if `n` is 0, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` is not defined in the given state, but since it's the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

The state of `matrix` being a square list of lists of integers and `total` being 0 does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but these states should be preserved.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is at least 1, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
