Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `total += matrix[i][i]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `matrix[i][i]`. 

Since `i` is 1, `matrix[i][i]` is equivalent to `matrix[1][1]`. 

The initial state of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]`, but the exact value of `total` is not specified. 

However, we can express the new value of `total` as the old value of `total` (which is `matrix[1][n-2]`) plus `matrix[1][1]`.

The values of `matrix`, `n`, and `i` are not changed by this statement.

Therefore, the output state is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` plus `matrix[1][1]`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` plus `matrix[1][1]`, and `i` is 1**
