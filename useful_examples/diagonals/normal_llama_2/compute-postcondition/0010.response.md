To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` plus `matrix[1][1]`.
- `i` is 1.

The code to execute is:
```python
total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]
```

Now, let's break down the impact of the code on the program:

- The value of `i` is 1.
- The expression `n - i - 1` becomes `n - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `n - 2`.
- The code accesses the element at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, which translates to `matrix[1][n - 2]`.
- The value of `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]`.

However, the initial state already mentions that `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` plus `matrix[1][1]`. Since the code only adds `matrix[1][n - 2]` to `total`, we can infer that the value of `matrix[1][1]` was already added to `total` before this line of code.

The new value of `total` is not explicitly calculable without knowing the exact values in the `matrix`, but we can express the change in the state.

The output state is:
- `matrix` remains a square list of lists of integers.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n-2]`, which was already included in the initial increase, so `total` now effectively includes the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` twice plus `matrix[1][1]`.
- `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by twice the value of `matrix[1][n-2]` plus `matrix[1][1]`, and `i` is 1**
