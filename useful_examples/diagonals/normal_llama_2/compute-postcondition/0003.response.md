To calculate the result, let's break down the code step by step.

The code `total += matrix[i][i]` is adding the value of `matrix[i][i]` to the current value of `total`. 

Since `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers and `i` is 0, `matrix[i][i]` refers to the first element of the first sublist in `matrix`.

The initial state of `total` is 0. 

Therefore, after execution, `total` will be the value of the first element of the first sublist in `matrix`.

The states of the other variables (`matrix`, `n`, `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is at least 1, `total` is the value of the first element of the first sublist in `matrix`, `i` is 0**
