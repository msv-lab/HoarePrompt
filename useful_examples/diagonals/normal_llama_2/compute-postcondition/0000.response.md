Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `n = len(matrix)` assigns the length of the `matrix` to the variable `n`. Since `matrix` is a square list of lists, the length of `matrix` represents the number of rows, which is equal to the number of columns.

The previous value of `n` is unknown, but after this assignment, `n` will hold the value of the length of `matrix`.

The state of `matrix` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the length of `matrix`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a square list of lists of integers, `n` is the length of `matrix`.**
