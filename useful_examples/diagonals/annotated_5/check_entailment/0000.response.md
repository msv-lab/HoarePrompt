Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `matrix_diagonal_sum(matrix)` that calculates the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix. It correctly iterates through the matrix to sum the diagonal elements from the top left to bottom right, and from the top right to bottom left. The annotations provided align with the code logic and accurately describe the functionality of the program. Additionally, the code handles the case where the matrix is empty (n=0) or negative dimensions by returning a sum of 0, which is consistent with the problem description. The program is correct for all potential cases.
