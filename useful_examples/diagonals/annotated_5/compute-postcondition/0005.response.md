According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[1][n - 2]`, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
