The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, where n is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of the values in the diagonal from the top left to bottom right of the matrix. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the total remains 0. The function returns the total sum calculated.
