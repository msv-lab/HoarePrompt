Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the square matrix `matrix`, which means `n` will hold the value of the number of rows or columns in the matrix. The value of `n` will be the same as the dimension of the square matrix. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n; n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix**.
Output State: **Precondition: matrix is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n; n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix**.
