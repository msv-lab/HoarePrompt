Example Answer: 
`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. The value of `total` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total` is increased by the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, `matrix` is a square 2D list of integers with dimensions n x n, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
