Example Answer:
The value at position `matrix[i][i]` is added to the `total`, which is the sum of values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. The specific values of the matrix elements and the current value of `total` are not provided, so the output state is: `total` is updated with the new sum of values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the new sum of values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1**
