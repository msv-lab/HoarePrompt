Example Answer:
The value at the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix is added to the current value of `total`. The current value of `i` is incremented by 1. After execution, the new value of `total` will be the sum of the previous `total` value and the value at the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix at the new `i` index. The new value of `i` will be one more than the previous value.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the new sum of values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left of the matrix, `i` is incremented by 1**
