According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. This means the loop can execute one more time. The states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are: `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and no other states need adjustment.
State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the sum of the values at matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][n-1], `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
