According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is a positive integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is now 0.
State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
