Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`, where `i` is 1 and `n` is the size of the square matrix. The updated value of `total` is the sum of the previous `total` value and the new value added. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated with the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[i][i]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is updated with the sum of the values at `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][n-1]`, `matrix[1][1]`, `matrix[i][i]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `total` is increased by the value at `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`**
