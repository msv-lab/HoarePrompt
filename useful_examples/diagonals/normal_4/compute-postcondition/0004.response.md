Example Answer:
The value at matrix[0][0] is added to the current value of `total`, and the value at matrix[i][n - i - 1] is accessed where i is 0 and n is a positive integer. The value at matrix[0][n-1] is added to `total`. The state of `total` is updated with this new value. Therefore, the Output State is: matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the sum of the values at matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][n-1], `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, total is updated with the sum of the values at matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][n-1], `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
