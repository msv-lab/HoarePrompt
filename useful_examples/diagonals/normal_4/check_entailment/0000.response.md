Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the rows of the square matrix and calculates the sum of values at the main diagonal and antidiagonal as required by the problem description. It ensures that no element is added twice by accessing the diagonal elements using `matrix[i][i]` and `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The function handles square matrices of any dimension by using the length of the matrix. Since the function accurately computes the sum of elements along both diagonals without adding any element twice, it aligns with the problem statement.
