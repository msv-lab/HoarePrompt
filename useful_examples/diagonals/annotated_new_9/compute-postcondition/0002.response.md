According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the matrix being a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer ensures that the loop can execute. `total` being 0 does not directly impact the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **matrix is a square matrix (n x n) where n is a positive integer, `total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
