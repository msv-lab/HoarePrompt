According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is less than `n+1`, and `n` remains the same. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i+1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is less than `n+2`, `n` remains the same**
