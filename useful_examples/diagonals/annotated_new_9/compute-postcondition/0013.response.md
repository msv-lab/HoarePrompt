Example Answer:
The function returns the value of `total`, which is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: total is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, i is less than n+1, n remains the same. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and total remains 0, and the function returns `total`.
Output State: **total is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, i is less than n+1, n remains the same. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and total remains 0, and the function returns `total`**
