Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the new diagonal element value `matrix[i][i]`, where `i` is less than `n+1`. The value of `n` remains the same. After execution, the new value of `total` will be the sum of the previous value of `total` and the diagonal element value at index `[i][i]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is less than `n+1`, `n` remains the same**
