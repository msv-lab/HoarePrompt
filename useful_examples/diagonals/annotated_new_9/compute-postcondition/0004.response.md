Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the diagonal element at index i=i, which is matrix[i][n - i - 1]. Since i is increased by 1 and the matrix is a square matrix, the next diagonal element to be added to total is matrix[i+1][n - (i+1) - 1]. Therefore, after execution, the value of `total` will be updated with the new diagonal element. 
Output State: **total is updated with the new diagonal element**
