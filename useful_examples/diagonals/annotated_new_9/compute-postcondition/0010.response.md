Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of the new diagonal element `matrix[i][n - i - 1]`. The loop variable `i` is less than `n+1`, and `n` remains the same. After execution, the `total` will be updated with the new diagonal element value. 
Output State: **`total` is updated with the new diagonal element value, `i` is less than `n+1`, `n` remains the same**
