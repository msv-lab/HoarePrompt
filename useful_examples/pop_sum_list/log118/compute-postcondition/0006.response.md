According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `input_list`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `input_list` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `input_list` contains at least one integer less than before, which implies that there are still elements remaining in `input_list`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `input_list` must still contain at least one integer. 

Since the current state indicates that `input_list` has at least one integer less than before, it is possible that `input_list` is not empty. However, to ensure that the loop can indeed execute one more time, we can state that `input_list` must have at least one integer remaining.

State: **`input_list` must have at least one integer remaining, `total_sum` is equal to `element`, and `element` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
