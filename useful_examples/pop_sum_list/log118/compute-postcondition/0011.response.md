The code `element = input_list.pop()` removes the last element from `input_list` and assigns it to `element`. Since `input_list` has at least one integer remaining, `element` will take the value of that last integer. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code executed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `input_list` has at least one integer less than before, `element` is the last integer from `input_list`, and `total_sum` is equal to the previous value plus the original value of `element`.

Output State: **`input_list` has at least one integer less, `element` is the last integer from `input_list`, `total_sum` is equal to the previous value plus `element`.**
