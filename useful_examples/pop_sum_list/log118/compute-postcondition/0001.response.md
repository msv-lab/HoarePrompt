According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `input_list` is not empty. Right before the loop, `input_list` is a list of integers. For the loop to execute at least once, `input_list` must contain at least one integer. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `input_list` must not be empty.

State: **`input_list` must contain at least one integer, `total_sum` is 0**
