Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the condition `if num > 1:` which only includes numbers greater than 1 in the average calculation. However, the problem description states that the program should find the average of the positive integers in a list, which includes 1. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will skip the number 1 and return an average of 2.5, which is incorrect. The correct average should be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2. 

The correct condition should be `if num > 0:` to include all positive integers in the calculation.
