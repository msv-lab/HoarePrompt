Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` depends on the elements in the list `numbers`, which may have been modified after the removal. The values of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers list has one less element (depending on the original list), total is 0, count is 0, and `num` has the value of the removed element.
Output State: **numbers list has one less element (depending on the original list), total is 0, count is 0, `num` has the value of the removed element**
