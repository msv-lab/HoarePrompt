Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the program should find the average of positive integers in a list, but the code only considers numbers greater than 1, which excludes the positive integer 1 from the calculation. Therefore, the code does not handle the case where the list contains the positive integer 1, leading to an incorrect result.
