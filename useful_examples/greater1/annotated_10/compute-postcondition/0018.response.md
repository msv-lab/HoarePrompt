Postcondition: ***`total`, `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, `num` is assigned the last element of the original list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the list `numbers` retains its original state. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating the skipping of non-positive numbers, and `total`, `count`, `numbers`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
