Postcondition: ***`total` and `count` are integers. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0 and `count` remains 0. In all cases, the program either increments the count and updates the total or skips the non-positive number based on the condition.***
