Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value of `num` which is an element from the `numbers` list. The value of `count` remains the same. After execution, the new value of `total` is the previous total plus the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated according to the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` remains the same, and `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element.
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` remains the same, and `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element**
