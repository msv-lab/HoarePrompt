According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the list `numbers` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `num` is assigned the last element of the original list. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `num` is greater than 1, then `total` should be increased by `num`, `count` should be incremented by 1, and `numbers` should retain its original state.
2. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, then no changes need to be made to `total`, `count`, `numbers`, and `num`. Just a message should be printed stating the skipping of non-positive numbers.

State: **`total`, `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, `num` is assigned the last element of the original list.**
