Example Answer:
The value `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. Since `numbers` is a non-empty list, `num` will be assigned the last element of the list. Therefore, the output state is: `total` and `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element.
Output State: **`total` and `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element**
