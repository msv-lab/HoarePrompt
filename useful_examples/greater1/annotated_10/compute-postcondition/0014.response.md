Example Answer: 
`num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, after popping one element, `num` will contain the last element of the original list. The values of `total` and `count` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total`, `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `num` is assigned the last element of the original list.
Output State: **`total`, `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, `num` is assigned the last element of the original list**
