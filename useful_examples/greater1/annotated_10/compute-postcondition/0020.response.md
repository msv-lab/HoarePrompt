Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, after the loop finishes executing, `total` will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were popped from the list, `count` will be the count of such numbers, and `numbers` will be an empty list. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total`, `count`, and `numbers` will remain 0.**
