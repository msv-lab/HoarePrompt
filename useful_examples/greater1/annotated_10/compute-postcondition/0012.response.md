Postcondition: ***`total`, `count` are integers. `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated to the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `numbers` has one less element. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total`, `count`, and `numbers` remain unchanged.***
