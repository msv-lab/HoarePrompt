According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `numbers` is not provided in the initial state description. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `numbers` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `numbers` to be a non-empty list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` and `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list**
