Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a list of integers numbers and iterates through the list, summing up positive numbers greater than 1 and counting them. It then calculates and returns the average of these positive numbers if there are any. If the input list contains only non-positive numbers, the function returns 0 for both the total and the count. If the list is empty, the function returns None. **

The annotations mention printing a message when encountering non-positive numbers, but this functionality is missing from the actual code.
