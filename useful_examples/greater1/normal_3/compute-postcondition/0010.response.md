Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less element after `pop()`), `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` as mentioned in the initial state statement. If `num` is not positive, a message is printed. The count is increased by 1.
