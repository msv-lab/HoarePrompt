The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

In Case 1, if the list `numbers` is not empty, the function will iterate through the list using `pop()` to remove elements one by one. If the popped number `num` is greater than 1, the function will increment `total` by `num` and `count` by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function will print a message and `total` and `count` will remain unchanged. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, and `count` will be the number of such positive numbers. If the initial list contains only non-positive numbers, both `total` and `count` will be 0. If `count` is not 0, the function will calculate and return the average as `total` divided by `count`.

In Case 2, if the initial list contains only non-positive numbers, both `total` and `count` will be 0. If there are positive numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, `total` will be the sum of all such numbers, and `count` will be the number of positive numbers greater than 1. If `count` is not 0, the function will calculate and return the average as `total` divided by `count.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the sum of positive numbers greater than 1, count the number of such positive numbers, and return the average of these positive numbers if there are any. If the initial list contains only non-positive numbers, the function will return 0 for both the total and the count. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers numbers, calculates the sum of positive numbers greater than 1, counts the number of such positive numbers, and returns the average if there are any. If the initial list contains only non-positive numbers, it returns 0 for both the total and the count.**
