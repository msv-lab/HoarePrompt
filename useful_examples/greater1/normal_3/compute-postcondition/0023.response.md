Postcondition: ***If the list `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute until all elements are removed by `pop()`. If the popped `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be incremented by `num` and `count` will increase by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program will print 'Skipping non-positive number: num' and `total` and `count` remain unchanged. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, `count` will be the number of positive numbers greater than 1 in the initial list. If the initial list contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will both be 0. In the else part, if `count` is not 0, the average will be calculated as `total` divided by `count`.***
