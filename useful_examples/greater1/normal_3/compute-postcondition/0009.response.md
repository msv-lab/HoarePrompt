Example Answer: 
`total` is updated by adding the value of `num`. If `num` is not positive, a message is printed. The list `numbers` has one less element after executing `pop()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less element after `pop()`), `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` as mentioned in the initial state statement. If `num` is not positive, a message is printed.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less element after `pop()`), `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` as mentioned in the initial state statement. If `num` is not positive, a message is printed.**
