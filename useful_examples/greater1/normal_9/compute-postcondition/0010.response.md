Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list, `total` has been incremented by `num`, and `count` has been increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list, `total` has been incremented by `num`, and `count` has been increased by 1**
