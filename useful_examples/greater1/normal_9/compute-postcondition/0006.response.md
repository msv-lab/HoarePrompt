Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated with the addition of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` is the last element removed from the list. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number:', `num`, and `total` remains 0 while `count` remains 0.***
