Postcondition: ***If the last removed number from `numbers` is greater than 1, `total` has been incremented by that number and `count` has been increased by 1. If the last removed number from `numbers` is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, and `num` holds the last removed non-positive number. In both cases, `count` is increased by 1. If `num` > 1, `total` is increased by `num`. Otherwise, a message is printed stating that a non-positive number was skipped.***
