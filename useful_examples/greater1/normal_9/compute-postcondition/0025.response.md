The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, both `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are elements in the list, `total` will hold the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will represent the count of such numbers, and `numbers` will be empty. After the loop finishes, if `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as `total / count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the average of all numbers greater than 1, and return None if there are no such numbers. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, calculates the average of numbers greater than 1 in the list. If there are no such numbers, it returns None.**
