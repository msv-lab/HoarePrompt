Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped, using the value stored in the variable `num`. This message is displayed to the user. The list `numbers` remains unchanged, with the last element removed and stored in the variable `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` holds the last removed non-positive number.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` holds the last removed non-positive number**
