Output State: **If the list `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are elements in the list and the conditions are met during the loop, `total` will hold the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will represent the count of such numbers, and `numbers` will be empty. After the execution of the code snippet, `average` will be calculated as `total / count`.**
