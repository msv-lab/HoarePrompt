Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` after removing it from the list. Since `numbers` has one less element now, the output state is: `numbers` has one less element, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list**
