Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, so the new value of `total` will be the sum of the previous `total` and `num`. The `numbers` list has one less element as `num` was removed from it. The value of `count` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` has been updated with the addition of `num`, `count` remains the same, and `num` holds the value of the removed element.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` has been updated with the addition of `num`, `count` remains the same, and `num` holds the value of the removed element**
