Output State: **If numbers is not empty, the loop removes all numbers greater than 1 from the list. If num > 1, total will be updated by adding num, count will be incremented by 1. If num <= 1, a message indicating a non-positive number is skipped will be displayed. After the loop finishes, numbers will be empty, total will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, count will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0. In all cases, after the if-else block executes, if count is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, average will be calculated as total divided by count.**
