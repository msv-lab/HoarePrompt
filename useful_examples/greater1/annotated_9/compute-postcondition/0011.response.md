Example Answer: 
The code prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped, where `num` is the last element removed from the list. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list**
