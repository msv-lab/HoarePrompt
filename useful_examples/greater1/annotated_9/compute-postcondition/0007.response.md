According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` still has elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has one less element. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. `numbers` should still have elements after removing one element.
2. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` should have been updated with the addition of `num`, `count` should have been increased by 1, and `num` should hold the value of the removed element.
3. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` should be 0, `count` should be 0, and `num` should hold the value of the removed element.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` has one less element, and the program state is correctly maintained after the execution of the if else block.**
