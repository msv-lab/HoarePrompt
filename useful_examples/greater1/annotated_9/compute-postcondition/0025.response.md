The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1: If the list `numbers` is not empty, the function will iterate through the list and remove all numbers greater than 1. For each number greater than 1, the total will be updated by adding that number, and the count will be incremented by 1. If a number less than or equal to 1 is encountered, a message indicating a non-positive number is skipped will be displayed. After the loop finishes, the list `numbers` will be empty, the variable `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, the variable `count` will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. In all cases, after the if-else block executes, if `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, the average will be calculated as `total` divided by `count`.

Case 2: The second case is the same as Case 1, with the same functionality.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, remove numbers greater than 1, calculate the sum and count of those numbers, and return the average if count is greater than 0. If the list is empty or no numbers greater than 1 are present, the function will return None.
