Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed; `num` is the removed last element, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed last element, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed; `num` is the removed last element, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed last element, `count` is incremented by 1**
