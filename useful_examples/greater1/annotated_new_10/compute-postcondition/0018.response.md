Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed; `num` is the removed last element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and no changes are made to `total` or `count`.***
