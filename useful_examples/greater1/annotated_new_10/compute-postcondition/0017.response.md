Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the message 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. The value of `num` was removed from the list `numbers`, which means `numbers` still contains the original list of numbers without the last element. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed; `num` is the removed last element.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed; `num` is the removed last element**
