Initial State: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `total` is an integer representing the sum of numbers, `count` is an integer representing the count of numbers processed.

The value of `num` is added to `total`, where `num` is the last element removed from `numbers`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by that value and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, a non-positive number was skipped.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `total` is increased by the last element removed from `numbers` if greater than 1, `count` is increased by 1 if the last element removed from `numbers` was greater than 1.**
