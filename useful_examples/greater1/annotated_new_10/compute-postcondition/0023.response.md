Postcondition: ***If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop continues executing, removing and storing the last element in `num`. If `num` > 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` â‰¤ 1, a message is printed and no changes are made to `total` or `count`. The loop continues until all elements in `numbers` have been processed. If `numbers` is initially an empty list, the loop does not execute, leaving `total` and `count` as 0. Finally, `average` is computed as `total / count`.***
