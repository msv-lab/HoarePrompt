According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. The loop body involves removing the last element from the list and checking if it meets certain conditions to update `total` and `count`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed and `num` is the removed last element. 

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the value of `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated and `count` is incremented. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints a message and no changes are made to `total` or `count`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must not be empty after removing the last element and the value of the new `num` should be considered to determine if `total` and `count` need to be adjusted.

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with the last two elements removed; `num` is the new last element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and no changes are made to `total` or `count`.**
