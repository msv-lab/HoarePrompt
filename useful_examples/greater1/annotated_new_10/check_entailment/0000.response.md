Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the program should find the average of the positive integers in a list. However, the code only considers numbers greater than 1, which excludes the number 1 itself. This means that the code does not handle the case where the list contains the number 1, which is a positive integer that should be included in the calculation of the average. Therefore, the code is incorrect according to the problem description. The annotations also mention that the code skips non-positive numbers, but it specifically does not mention handling the number 1.

To correct the code, the condition `if num > 1:` should be changed to `if num > 0:` to include the number 1 in the calculation of the average.
