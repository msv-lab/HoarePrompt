Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input. It iterates through each element in the list, removing the last element and storing it in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, it increments the `total` by `num` and increases the `count` by 1. If `num` is 1 or less, it prints a message. After processing all elements, if there are positive integers greater than 1, it calculates the average of those numbers as `total / count` and returns it. If the list is empty or contains no positive integers greater than 1, it returns None.**

Potential edge cases and missing logic:
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `numbers` contains non-integer elements. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- If `numbers` contains all non-positive integers or only contains 1s, the function will return None without calculating an average. This behavior should be clarified for better understanding.
