Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, the loop iterates through each element, removing the last element and storing it in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is 1 or less, a message is printed. After processing all elements, `total` contains the sum of positive integers greater than 1, `count` represents their count, `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `numbers` remain unchanged.**
