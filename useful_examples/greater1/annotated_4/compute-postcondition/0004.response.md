Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the removed integer, `count` is 1, `num` is the removed integer**
