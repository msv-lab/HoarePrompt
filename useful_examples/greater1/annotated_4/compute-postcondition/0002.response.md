Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `numbers` by using the `pop()` method. Since `numbers` is a list of integers, and `pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list, `num` will have the value of the removed integer. The `total` and `count` variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the removed integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the removed integer**
