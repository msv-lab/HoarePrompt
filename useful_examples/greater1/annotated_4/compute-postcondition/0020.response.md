Output State: **If the list `numbers` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each element. For each iteration, the last element of `numbers` will be removed and stored in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be incremented by the value of `num` and `count` will be increased by 1. If `num` is 1 or less, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. This process will continue until all elements in `numbers` have been processed. After the loop finishes, `total` will contain the sum of all positive integers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` will represent the count of such integers, and `numbers` will be empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total`, `count`, and `numbers` will remain at their initial values.**
