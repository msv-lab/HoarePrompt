Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, `total` contains the sum of all positive integers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` represents the count of such integers, and `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `numbers` remain at their initial values. The `average` is calculated as `total / count`.**
