Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and not empty. If num is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by the value of num and `count` is increased by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of num. In both cases, the state of `numbers`, `total`, and `count` is adjusted based on the value of the last element removed, handling both positive and non-positive numbers appropriately.***
