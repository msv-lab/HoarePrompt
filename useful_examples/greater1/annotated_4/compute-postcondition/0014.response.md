Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. Since the list is not empty, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of `num`. The specific adjustments depend on the value of the last element removed. The updated state of the variables will vary based on the actual value of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and not empty, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of the last element removed**
