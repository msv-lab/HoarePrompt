Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the removed positive integer and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is not positive, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. If `num` is 1 or less, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.***
