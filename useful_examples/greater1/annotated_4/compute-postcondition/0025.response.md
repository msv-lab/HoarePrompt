The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is not empty, the function iterates through each element, removing the last element and storing it in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is 1 or less, a message is printed. After processing all elements, `total` contains the sum of positive integers greater than 1, `count` represents their count, and `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `numbers` remain unchanged. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, the average is calculated as `total / count`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through each element to calculate the sum of positive integers greater than 1, and return the average of those numbers. If the list is empty or no positive integers greater than 1 are found, the function returns None.
