Example Answer:
If the removed integer `num` is not positive, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. This means that the program skips processing for non-positive numbers. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the removed positive integer if it is greater than 1, otherwise `total` remains 0, `count` is 1 if the removed integer is greater than 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `num` is the removed integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the removed positive integer if it is greater than 1, otherwise `total` remains 0, `count` is 1 if the removed integer is greater than 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `num` is the removed integer**
