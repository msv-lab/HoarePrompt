Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The list `numbers` had its last element removed, so the `total` is updated by adding the removed element. The `count` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and not empty, `total` is adjusted based on the value of the last element removed, `count` remains the same.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed and not empty, `total` is adjusted based on the value of the last element removed, `count` remains the same**
