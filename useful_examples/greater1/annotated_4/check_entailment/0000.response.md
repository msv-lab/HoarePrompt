Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the condition `if num > 1` within the while loop. The problem description states that the program should find the average of positive integers, but the current condition only considers integers greater than 1, excluding the number 1 itself. This means that the program will not include the integer 1 in the calculation of the average, which is not in line with the problem description.

As an example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the program will skip the number 1 and only consider 2 and 3 for the average calculation. This inconsistency makes the program incorrect according to the problem description.
