The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1:
- If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0.
- If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0.
- If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty.
- At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list.
- If `count` is 0, the function will return None.
- Otherwise, if `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0.
- If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0.
- If `numbers` contains positive numbers, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of positive numbers divided by the count of positive numbers.

Case 2:
- If `numbers` is initially empty, the function will return None.
- If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0.
- If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the function will calculate the average of all positive numbers and return that value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list to calculate the total sum and count of positive numbers, and then return different outputs based on the conditions specified in Case 1 and Case 2.
