Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method, which removes and returns the last element of the list. The value of `num` will be the last integer in the list `numbers`. The `total` and `count` variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list**
