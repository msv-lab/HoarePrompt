Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, and `num` is the last element removed from the list of `numbers`. The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the sum of its previous value and the value of `num`, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the sum of its previous value and the value of `num`, `count` is 0**
