Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The value of `num` is obtained by popping it from the `numbers` list, so `num` is the last element of the list. After adding `num` to `total`, the last element is removed from the `numbers` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element; `num` is added to `total`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element; `num` is added to `total`**
