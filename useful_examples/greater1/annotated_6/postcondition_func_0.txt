The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function will return None. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the function will print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' for each element, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the function will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, the function will calculate the average of all positive numbers and return that value.
