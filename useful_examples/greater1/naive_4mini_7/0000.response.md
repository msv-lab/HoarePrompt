Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the average of positive integers in a list, but it incorrectly identifies positive integers. Specifically, it checks if a number is greater than 1 (`if num > 1:`), which means it will skip the positive integer `1`. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will:
- Skip `1` (since it's not greater than 1)
- Add `2` and `3` to the total
- The count will be `2` (for `2` and `3`), resulting in an average of `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

However, the correct average should include `1`, which would be `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. 

Therefore, the program fails to handle this edge case correctly, leading to an incorrect average computation.
