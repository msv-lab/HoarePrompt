Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped, where `num` is the popped integer from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` has at least one element removed, and `num` is the removed integer. The output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed, `num` is the popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed, `num` is the popped integer**
