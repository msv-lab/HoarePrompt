Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `count` is 0, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated with the sum of the popped integer value, count is 1, num is the popped integer value.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated with the sum of the popped integer value, count is 1, num is the popped integer value**
