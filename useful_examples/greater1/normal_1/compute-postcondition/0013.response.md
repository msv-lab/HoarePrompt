According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed and `num` is the popped integer.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the list `numbers` still has elements, then no adjustment is needed for `numbers`.
- If `num` is greater than 1, `total` should be increased by the value of `num` and `count` should be incremented by 1.
- If `num` is less than or equal to 1, then the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' should be printed.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed. `num` is the popped integer, `total` may have been increased if `num` was greater than 1 and `count` may have been incremented, or 'Skipping non-positive number: num' message has been printed if `num` was less than or equal to 1**
