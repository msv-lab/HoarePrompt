Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `numbers`, processes positive integers by summing them and calculating the average, then returns the calculated average. If `numbers` is empty, the function returns None. If `numbers` contains only non-positive integers, it prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' for each element. If there are positive integers in `numbers`, the function calculates the average correctly. However, there is a missing functionality where the loop does not handle negative integers and just skips them without updating the total or count. **
