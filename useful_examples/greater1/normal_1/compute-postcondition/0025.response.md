The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function sets `total` to 0, `count` to 0, and `num` to undefined. If `numbers` contains only non-positive integers, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' for each element in `numbers` and keeps `total` as 0, `count` as 0, and `num` as undefined. If `numbers` contains positive integers, after processing the loop, `numbers` becomes empty, `total` is the sum of positive integers, `count` is the count of positive integers processed, `num` is the last popped integer, and `average` is calculated as `total / count`. The function returns the calculated `average`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers`, processes positive integers, calculates the average, and returns the calculated average.**
