Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The `num` value was removed from the `numbers` list before this operation. The list `numbers` now has one less element, and the `total` has been increased by the value of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the popped integer; `total` is increased by the value of `num`**
