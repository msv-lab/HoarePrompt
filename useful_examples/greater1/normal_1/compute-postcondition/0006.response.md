Postcondition: ***numbers is a list of integers with one less element. If num > 1, total is updated with the sum of the popped integer value, count is increased by 1, and num is the popped integer value. If num is non-positive, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number:', and total remains 0, count remains 0, and num is the popped integer value.***
