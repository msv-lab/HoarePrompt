Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed, `num` is the popped integer. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is incremented. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In all cases, the program handles the scenario appropriately based on the value of `num`.***
