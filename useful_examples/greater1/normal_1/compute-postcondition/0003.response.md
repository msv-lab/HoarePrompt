Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`. Since `num` is the popped integer value from the list `numbers`, the total is incremented by the popped integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated with the sum of the popped integer value, count is 0, num is the popped integer value.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated with the sum of the popped integer value, count is 0, num is the popped integer value**
