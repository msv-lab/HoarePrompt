Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It only considers positive integers for calculating the average, but it should be considering all positive integers. The code skips over non-positive integers without updating the total or count, leading to incorrect average calculation. The program description states that the function should find the average of the positive integers in the list, but it is not handling non-positive integers correctly.

Output hints do not provide examples of the code handling non-positive integers, so they do not fully agree with the code. The code is missing the functionality to include all positive integers in the calculation of the average, making it incorrect.
