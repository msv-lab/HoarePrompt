Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem statement asks to find the average of the positive integers in a list, but the program considers only integers greater than 1 as positive. This means that the program will skip the number 1, which is a positive integer, and will not include it in the calculation of the average.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the program will skip the number 1 and will return the average of 2 and 3, which is 2.5. However, the correct average of the positive integers in the list is (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.0.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
