Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the average of positive integers in the list, excluding numbers less than or equal to 1. However, the code only checks if the number is greater than 1, instead of checking if it is positive. This means that the code will include numbers that are equal to 1 in the calculation of the average, which is not desired. 

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the list is empty. The problem description specifies that if the list is empty, the function should return None. However, the code does not have any logic to check for an empty list and will result in an error when trying to pop an element from an empty list.

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the discrepancies mentioned above.
