Example Answer:
The code prints out "Skipping non-positive number:" followed by the value of `num`. The variables `numbers`, `total`, and `count` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value**
