Example Answer: 
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` has one less element, and `num` now holds the popped value. The value of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the popped value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the popped value**
