According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, and `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`. Additionally, `num` holds the popped value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last popped `num` is greater than 1, `total` should be increased by `num` and `count` should be incremented by 1.
- If the last popped `num` is less than or equal to 1, no changes should be made to `total` or `count`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value.**
