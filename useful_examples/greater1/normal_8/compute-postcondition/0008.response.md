The code pops the last element from the list `numbers` and assigns it to the variable `num`. The list `numbers` now has one less element. The value of `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value**
