According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last popped `num` is greater than 1, then `num` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
- If the last popped `num` is less than or equal to 1, then `num` needs to be less than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, and `num` holds the popped value.**
