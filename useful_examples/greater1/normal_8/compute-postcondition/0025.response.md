The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function returns None. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, the function returns None. If there are elements greater than 1 in `numbers`, the function will iterate through each element, updating `total` with the sum of those elements and `count` with the number of elements greater than 1. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all elements greater than 1 in the initial `numbers`, and `count` will be the count of elements greater than 1. 

If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function calculates the `average` as the total divided by count and returns it. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the sum and average of elements greater than 1 in the list, and return the average if count is not 0. If count is 0 or the list is empty, the function returns None.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers numbers, calculates the sum and average of elements greater than 1. If count is not 0, it returns the average. If count is 0 or the list is empty, it returns None.**
