Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, so the new value of `total` is the previous value of `total` plus `num`. The states of `numbers` and `count` are not affected. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value, `total` is updated with the addition of `num`**
