Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `count` and other variables are unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value, `total` is updated with the addition of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value, `total` is updated with the addition of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1**
