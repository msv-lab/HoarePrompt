Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0. If all elements in `numbers` are less than or equal to 1, the loop will not update `total` or `count`. If there are elements greater than 1 in `numbers`, the loop will iterate through each, updating `total` with the sum of those elements and `count` with the number of elements greater than 1. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all elements greater than 1 in the initial `numbers`, `count` will be the count of elements greater than 1. If `count` is 0, the function returns None, otherwise `average` is calculated as the total divided by count.***
