Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, and `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The previous value of `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` has the popped value from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has one less element, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 0, and `num` has been added to `total`.
Output State: **`numbers` list has one less element, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 0, and `num` has been added to `total`**
