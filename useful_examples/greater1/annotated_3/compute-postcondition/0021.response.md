Output State: **If 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element greater than 1, it will be added to 'total' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If the popped element is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be empty, 'total' will be the sum of all positive numbers in the original list, 'count' will be the number of positive numbers in the original list, and 'num' will not have a value. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the loop will not execute and 'total', 'count', and 'num' will remain unchanged.**
