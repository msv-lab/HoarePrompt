Example Answer: 
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:', num, where num is a variable. The variables total, count, and num are not affected by this print statement, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total`, `count`, and `num` adjusted accordingly**
