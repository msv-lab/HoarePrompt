The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If 'numbers' is not empty, the function iterates through the list, popping elements one by one. If the popped element is greater than 1, it is added to 'total' and 'count' is incremented by 1. If the popped element is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list, 'count' is the number of positive numbers in the original list, and 'num' does not have a value. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and 'total', 'count', and 'num' remain unchanged. If 'count' is 0, the function returns None; otherwise, the 'average' is calculated as the total divided by count.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list to calculate the sum of positive numbers and the count of positive numbers, and then return the average of the positive numbers if there are any. If there are no positive numbers, it returns None.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers numbers and calculates the average of positive numbers in the list. If there are no positive numbers, it returns None.**
