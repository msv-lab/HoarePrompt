Output State: **If 'numbers' is not empty, the loop continues to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element greater than 1, it is added to 'total' and 'count' is incremented by 1. If the popped element is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list, 'count' is the number of positive numbers in the original list, 'num' does not have a value. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the loop does not execute and 'total', 'count', and 'num' remain unchanged. In either case, if 'count' is 0, the function returns None, else 'average' is calculated as the total divided by count.**
