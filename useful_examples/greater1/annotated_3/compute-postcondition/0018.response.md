Postcondition: ***`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In all cases, `count` is adjusted accordingly based on the condition of `num`.***
