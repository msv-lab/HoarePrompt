Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is adjusted accordingly, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is adjusted accordingly, `count` is increased by 1**
