Example Answer:
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`, which is the last element in the `numbers` list. The `num` is removed from the list, so `numbers` now has one less element. The `total` and `count` variables are adjusted based on the removed `num` value. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has one less element, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` list has one less element, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list**
