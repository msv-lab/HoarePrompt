According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
- If the last removed `num` from the list is greater than 1, then `total` needs to be incremented by the value of `num` and `count` needs to be increased by 1.
- If the last removed `num` from the list is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.
- In either case, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list.

State: **`numbers` list has one less element. If the last removed `num` is greater than 1, then `total` is incremented by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If the last removed `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.**
