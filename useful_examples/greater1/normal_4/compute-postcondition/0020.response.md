Output State: **If the numbers list is not empty, the loop will continue to execute. If the last removed `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be incremented by the value of `num` and `count` will be increased by 1. If the last removed `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and the numbers list will be empty. If the initial numbers list contains only non-positive integers or is empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0.**
