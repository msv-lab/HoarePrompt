Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. There was a number removed from the `numbers` list, so the `total` value is adjusted based on the last removed `num`. The state of the `numbers` list is affected by the removal of one element. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has one less element, `total` is adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` list has one less element, `total` is adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list, `count` is increased by 1**
