According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If the `numbers` list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `numbers` list has one less element.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last `num` removed from the list is greater than 1, `total` should be updated to include the value of `num`.
- `count` should be incremented by 1.
- If the last `num` removed from the list is less than or equal to 1, `total` should remain 0 and `count` should remain 0.

State: **numbers list has one less element, total and count adjusted based on the last removed num from the list**
