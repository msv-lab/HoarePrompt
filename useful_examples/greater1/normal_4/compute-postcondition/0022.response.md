Output State: **If the numbers list is not empty and all the numbers in the list are greater than 1, the loop will execute and remove each number one by one. If the last removed `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be incremented by the value of `num` and `count` will be increased by 1. If the last removed `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and the numbers list will be empty. If the initial numbers list contains only non-positive integers or is empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. Then, `average` will be calculated as the division of `total` by `count`.**
