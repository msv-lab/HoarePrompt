Example Answer:
The last integer from the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` depends on the last element of the `numbers` list. The `total` and `count` variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **numbers list has one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the last integer removed from the list**
