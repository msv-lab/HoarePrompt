According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` has one less element. To execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. Adjust `numbers` to have one less element than the current state.
2. Update `total` by adding the value of the removed element (`num`) to the current total.
3. Increase `count` by 1 if the removed element `num` is greater than 1.
4. Adjust `num` based on the next element in the `numbers` list.
5. If the next `num` is not greater than 1, print 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`.

State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is updated by adding `num`, `count` is increased by 1 if `num` is greater than 1, and `num` is adjusted accordingly**.
