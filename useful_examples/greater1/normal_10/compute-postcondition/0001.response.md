Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the value 0, and `numbers` is a list of integers with some values, and `total` is 0. No changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
