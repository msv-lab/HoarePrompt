The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If the `numbers` list is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `num` will remain 0. If `numbers` is not empty, the function iterates through the list, removing numbers one by one. For each number greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding the removed number, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value. If a number not greater than 1 is removed, 'Skipping non-positive number:' is printed followed by the value of the removed number. After the loop, `total` contains the sum of all numbers removed that were greater than 1, `count` represents the count of such numbers, and `num` holds the last removed integer value. If `numbers` is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `num` will remain 0. After the if-else block, `average` is calculated as `total / count` if `count` is not 0; otherwise, None is returned.

Case_2: This case is the same as Case_1, with the exact same functionality and return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through it to remove numbers, update `total`, `count`, and `num` accordingly, and calculate the average of the removed numbers if there are any greater than 1. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function returns 0 for `total`, `count`, and `num`, and None for the `average`.
