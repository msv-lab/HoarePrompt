Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, so `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The value of `count` remains the same, depending on whether `num` is greater than 1 or not. The state of the variables after execution is as follows:
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is updated with the sum of previous total and `num`, `count` remains the same based on the value of `num`, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
