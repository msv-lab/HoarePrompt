Output State: **If the `numbers` list is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `num` remain 0. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop removes numbers one by one until the list is empty. For each number greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding the removed number, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value. If a number not greater than 1 is removed, 'Skipping non-positive number:' is printed followed by the value of the removed number. After the loop, `total` contains the sum of all numbers removed that were greater than 1, `count` represents the count of such numbers, and `num` holds the last removed integer value. If `numbers` is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `num` will remain 0. After the if else block, `average` is calculated as `total / count` if `count` is not 0, otherwise, None is returned.**
