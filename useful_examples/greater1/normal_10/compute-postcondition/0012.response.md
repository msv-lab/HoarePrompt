Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers. If `num` > 1, `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value. If `num` is not greater than 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. In both cases, the state of the program variables is maintained according to the described conditions.***
