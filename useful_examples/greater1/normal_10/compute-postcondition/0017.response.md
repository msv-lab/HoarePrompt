Example Answer:
The `num` variable is printed as 'Skipping non-positive number:', followed by the value of `num`. This print statement does not affect the state of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total`, `count`, and `num` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total`, `count`, and `num` are adjusted accordingly**
