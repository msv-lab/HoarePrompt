Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the value stored in `num`. The previous values of `total` and `num` are 0 and the last element of the original list respectively. After execution, the new value of `total` will be the sum of the previous `total` and `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
