Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is updated with the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
