The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, iterates through the list to remove numbers, updates `total`, `count`, and `num` accordingly, and calculates the average of the removed numbers if there are any greater than 1. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function returns 0 for `total`, `count`, and `num`, and None for the `average`. If the list contains only non-positive numbers, the function will return None.
