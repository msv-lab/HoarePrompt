According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- If `num` is greater than 1: `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1.
- If `num` is less than or equal to 1: `total` is 0 and `count` is 0.
- If `num` is not positive, a message is printed stating that the non-positive number is skipped.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the loop is to execute one more time, the loop body should have modified the `numbers` list by either removing elements or changing its values.
2. If the loop is to execute one more time, the conditions within the loop body should have been such that they allow for the loop to continue based on the values of `num`.

State: **Adjustments depend on the modifications made to `numbers` and the conditions involving `num` within the loop body**.
