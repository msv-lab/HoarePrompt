Postcondition: ***`numbers` has fewer elements, `num` has a new value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. In both cases, the state of `total` and `count` may be adjusted accordingly.***
