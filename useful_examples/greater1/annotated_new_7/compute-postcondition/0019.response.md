According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `numbers` has elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `num` is greater than 1, then `total` should be incremented by the value of `num` and `count` should be increased by 1.
- If `num` is less than or equal to 1, then the program should print 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`numbers` has fewer elements, `num` has a new value, `total` and `count` may be adjusted accordingly based on the value of `num`.**
