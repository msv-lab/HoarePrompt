Example Answer: 
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the list `numbers`. The specific value of `numbers` is not provided, so the exact value of `num` cannot be determined. The state of `numbers` changes as the popped value is removed from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is modified due to popping an element, and `num` is assigned the popped value from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is modified due to popping an element, and `num` is assigned the popped value from the list**
