Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has fewer elements, `num` has a new value, `total` is adjusted, and `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` has fewer elements, `num` has a new value, `total` is adjusted, and `count` is increased by 1**
