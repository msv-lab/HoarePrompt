Example Answer: 
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`, which is the popped element from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list has been modified by popping an element, and `num` now holds the popped value. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is modified due to popping an element, and `num` is assigned the popped value from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is modified due to popping an element, and `num` is assigned the popped value from the list**
