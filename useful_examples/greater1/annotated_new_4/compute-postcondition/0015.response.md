Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to the `total` variable. The list `numbers` has at least one element removed, and the removed integer value is stored in `num`. Therefore, after execution, the `total` will be increased by the value of `num`. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value; `total` is updated with the value of `num`**
