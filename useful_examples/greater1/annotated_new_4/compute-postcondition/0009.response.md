Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, where `num` holds the removed integer. The list `numbers` still has at least one element remaining. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` remains unchanged**
