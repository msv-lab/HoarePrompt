Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value; `total` is updated with the value of `num`; `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value; `total` is updated with the value of `num`; `count` is increased by 1**
