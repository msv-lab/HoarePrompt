Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the removed element, `count` is 1, and `num` contains the value of the removed element. If `num` is not greater than 1, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` contains the value of the removed element, and the code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value in `num`.***
