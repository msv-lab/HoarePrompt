Example Answer:
The value of `num` gets added to `total`, so `total` increases by the value of `num`. The `numbers` list remains unchanged, as only the last element was removed and stored in `num`. The `count` variable stays the same because it was not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the removed element, `count` is 0, `num` contains the value of the removed element**
