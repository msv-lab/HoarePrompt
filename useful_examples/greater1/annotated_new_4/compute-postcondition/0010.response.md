Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` is increased by 1**
