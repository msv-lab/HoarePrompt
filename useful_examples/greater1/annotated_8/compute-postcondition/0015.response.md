Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of the last element of the list `num`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with elements remaining, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the last element of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with elements remaining, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the last element of `num`**
