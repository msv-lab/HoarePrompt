Example Answer:
The `total` is increased by the value of `num`, and the `count` is increased by 1. The last element `num` is greater than 1, so after execution, the `total` is updated, `count` is incremented by 1, and the list `numbers` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and the last element `num` is greater than 1**
