Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`. Since `num` is the last element of the original list `numbers`, and `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, the value of `num` is the last element of the original list. Therefore, `total` is increased by the value of the last element of the original list. The values of `count` and `numbers` are not affected.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is increased by the value of the last element of the original list, `count` is 0, `num` is the last element of the original list**
