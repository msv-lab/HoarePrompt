Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If the last element `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is not positive, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In any case, after the if-else block execution, the final state includes the modified `numbers` list, the updated value of `total`, the updated value of `count`, and the value of `num` as the last element of the original list.***
