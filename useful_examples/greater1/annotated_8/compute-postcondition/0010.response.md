Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and the last element `num` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and the last element `num` is greater than 1**
