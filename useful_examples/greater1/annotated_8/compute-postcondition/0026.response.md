Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input. If the list contains positive integers, the function iterates through the list, calculating the sum of all positive integers and the count of positive integers processed. If any positive integers are found, the function also calculates and returns the average of the positive integers. If the list is empty or contains no positive integers, the function returns None. Additionally, the function prints a message when encountering non-positive numbers during processing.**
