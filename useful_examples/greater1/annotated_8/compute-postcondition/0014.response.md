Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The variables `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of `num`. The specific values of `total` and `count` are not provided, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with elements remaining, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the last element of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with elements remaining, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the last element of `num`**
