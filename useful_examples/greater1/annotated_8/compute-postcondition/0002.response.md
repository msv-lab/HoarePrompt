Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` is now the last element of the original list `numbers`. The `total` and `count` variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the last element of the original list `numbers`**
