Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `num`, but the previous value of `total` and the value of `num` are unknown. The state of the `count` variable may need to be adjusted based on the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: *numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num*.
Output State: ***numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num***
