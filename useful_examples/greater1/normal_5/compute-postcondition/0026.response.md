Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `numbers`, iterates through each element in the list, calculates the average of all elements greater than 1, and returns the average. If the list is empty, the function returns None. However, there is a missing logic in the code since the loop will not terminate if the elements in the list are not greater than 1, causing an infinite loop. This missing logic should be addressed to ensure proper functionality.**
