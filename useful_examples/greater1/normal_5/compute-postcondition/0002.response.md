Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` by using the `pop` method, which removes and returns the last element of the list. The `total` and `count` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **numbers list has one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the last element from the list**
