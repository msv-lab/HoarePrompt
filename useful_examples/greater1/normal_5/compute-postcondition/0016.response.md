Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num; `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num; `count` is increased by 1**
