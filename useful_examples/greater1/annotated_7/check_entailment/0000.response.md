Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the condition `if num > 1:`. The problem description specifies that the program should find the average of positive integers in the list, which means numbers greater than 0. However, the code is only considering numbers greater than 1, excluding positive integers less than or equal to 1. This means that the program will not correctly calculate the average of all positive integers in the list. 

For example, if the input list is `[2, 3, 1, 4]`, the program will only consider `2`, `3`, and `4` for calculating the average, omitting `1`, which is a positive integer. This violates the problem description and makes the program incorrect.
