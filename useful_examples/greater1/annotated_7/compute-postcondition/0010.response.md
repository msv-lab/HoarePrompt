Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The last element of the list `numbers` is removed, and `num` now holds that value. The `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element, but the exact calculation is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element, `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `num` is the last element removed from the list, and `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element, `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `num` is the last element removed from the list, and `count` is incremented by 1**
