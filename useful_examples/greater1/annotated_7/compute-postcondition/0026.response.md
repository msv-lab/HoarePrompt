Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input. It iterates through the list, summing up all elements greater than 1 and counting them. If there are no elements greater than 1, it returns None. After the loop, it calculates the average of the elements greater than 1 and returns that value. If there are non-positive numbers in the list, a message is printed for each, but the sum and count are not affected. **
