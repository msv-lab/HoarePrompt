Output State: **If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will be the sum of all elements in the original list that were greater than 1, `count` will be the number of elements in the original list that were greater than 1. If there are no elements greater than 1 in the original list, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are non-positive numbers in the list, a message will be printed for each, but no changes will be made to `total` and `count`.**
