Example Answer: 
`total` is updated by adding the value of `num`, which is the last element removed from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` has at least 1 less element now, so the new `total` is the previous total plus the value of `num`. The `count` is also updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element, `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element and `num`, `count` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `num` is the last element removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element, `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element and `num`, `count` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `num` is the last element removed from the list**
