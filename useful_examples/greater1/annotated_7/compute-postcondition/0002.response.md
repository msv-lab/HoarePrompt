Example Answer:
The value `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` due to the `pop()` method. The list `numbers` will have one less element. The value of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list**
