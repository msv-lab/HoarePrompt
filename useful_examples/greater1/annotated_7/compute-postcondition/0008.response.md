Example Answer:
The last element (`num`) is removed from the `numbers` list using the `pop()` method. The removed element is assigned to `num`. If the removed element is greater than 1, the `total` is updated to be the sum of the removed element and the previous total, and `count` is set to 1. If the removed element is not greater than 1, `total` and `count` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element, `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `count` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `num` is the last element removed from the list.**
