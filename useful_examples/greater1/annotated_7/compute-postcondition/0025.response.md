The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `numbers` will be an empty list. If there are elements greater than 1 in the original list, `total` will be the sum of those elements, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If there are no elements greater than 1, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are non-positive numbers in the list, a message will be printed for each, but `total` and `count` will not be changed. If count is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as `total / count`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list to calculate the sum of elements greater than 1, the count of such elements, and ultimately return the average of those elements. If there are no elements greater than 1 or if the list is empty, the function will return None.
