Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of the last element removed from the list and the previous total if the last element is greater than 1, `count` is 1 if the last element is greater than 1, and `num` is the last element removed from the list. If the last element is not greater than 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list. In all cases, the list `numbers` has one less element after the execution of the if else block.***
