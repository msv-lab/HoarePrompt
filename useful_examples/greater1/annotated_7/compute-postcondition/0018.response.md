Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the last element is removed from the list. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` and `count` are updated based on the removal of the last element, and the last element is removed from the list. If `num` is non-positive, a message is printed, and no changes are made to `total`, `count`, or `numbers`.***
