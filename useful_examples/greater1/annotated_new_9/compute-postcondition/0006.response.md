Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of the removed value (if greater than 1) and the previous total, `count` is 1 if the removed value is greater than 1, and `num` is the value removed from the list. If the removed value is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and `num` is still the value removed from the list.***
