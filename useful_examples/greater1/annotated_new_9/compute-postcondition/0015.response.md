Example Answer:
The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num`. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. The value of `count` is increased by 1 if `num` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated based on the sum of the removed value and the previous total, count is increased by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1, num is the value removed from the list. If num is greater than 1, total is incremented by num, count is increased by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated based on the sum of the removed value and the previous total, count is increased by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1, num is the value removed from the list. If num is greater than 1, total is incremented by num, count is increased by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'**
