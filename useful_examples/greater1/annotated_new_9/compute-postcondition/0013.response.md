According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last removed value `num` was greater than 1, then `total` needs to be incremented by `num`.
- If the last removed value `num` was greater than 1, then `count` needs to be increased by 1.
- If the last removed value `num` was less than or equal to 1, no adjustments need to be made to `total` or `count`, but a message should be printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.
- The list `numbers` should have one less element after the previous iteration.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated based on the sum of the removed value (if greater than 1) and the previous total, `count` is increased by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1, and `num` is the value removed from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.**
