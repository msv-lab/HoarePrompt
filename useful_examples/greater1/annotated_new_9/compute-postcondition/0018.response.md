Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated based on the sum of the removed value and the previous total, `count` is increased by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. The overall state of the program after execution covers all cases, ensuring proper handling of edge cases related to both positive and non-positive numbers.***
