Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If the last removed element `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program outputs 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. In all cases, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of the last removed element.***
