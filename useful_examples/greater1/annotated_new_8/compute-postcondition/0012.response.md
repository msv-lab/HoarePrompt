Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of the last removed element. `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed: 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.***
