Example Answer:
The last element of the `numbers` list is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` depends on the last element of the `numbers` list. If the last element is 5, then `num` will be 5. If the last element is 10, then `num` will be 10. The `total` and `count` variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed**
