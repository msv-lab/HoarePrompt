Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The list `numbers` now contains the elements with the last one removed. The value of `total` and `count` could be adjusted based on the value of the removed element. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of the last removed element, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed**
