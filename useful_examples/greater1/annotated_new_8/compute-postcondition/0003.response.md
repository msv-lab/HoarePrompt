Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed from the list. The total is incremented by the value of the last removed element. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is incremented by the value of the last removed element, `count` is 0, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is incremented by the value of the last removed element, `count` is 0, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed**
