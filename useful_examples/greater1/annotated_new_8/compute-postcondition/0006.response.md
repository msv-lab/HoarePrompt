Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is either incremented by the value of the last removed element if num is greater than 1, `count` is 1 in this case, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed. If num is not greater than 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed, and the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.***
