According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the list `numbers` still has elements after removing the last element, no adjustment is needed for `numbers`.
2. If the last removed element `num` is greater than 1, then `total` needs to be incremented by the value of `num`, `count` needs to be set to 1, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed.
3. If the last removed element `num` is not greater than 1, then `total` remains unchanged at 0, `count` remains at 0, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed, and the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the value of the last removed element, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed accordingly**
