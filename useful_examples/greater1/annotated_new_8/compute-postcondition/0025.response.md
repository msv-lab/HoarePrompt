The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If `numbers` is initially empty, the function sets `numbers` to be empty, `total` to be 0, `count` to be 0, `num` is not defined, and `average` will not be calculated. 
Case_2: If `numbers` is not empty, the function sets `numbers` to be empty, calculates `total` as the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, calculates `count` as the count of such numbers, sets `num` as the value of the last removed element, and calculates `average` as the average of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, and based on the conditions mentioned in Case_1 and Case_2, perform the specified operations and return the corresponding values.
