The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, calculates the total sum of integers greater than 1, counts the number of such integers, and computes the average of those numbers. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function sets `numbers` to be empty, `total` to be 0, `count` to be 0, `num` is not defined, and `average` will not be calculated. If `numbers` is not empty, the function sets `numbers` to be empty, calculates `total` as the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, calculates `count` as the count of such numbers, sets `num` as the value of the last removed element, and calculates `average` as the average of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list.
