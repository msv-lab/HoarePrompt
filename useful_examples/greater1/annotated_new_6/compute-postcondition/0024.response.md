Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue until all elements in `numbers` have been processed. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will contain the sum of all integers greater than 1 that were removed from `numbers`, `count` will represent the total count of integers greater than 1 that were removed. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as the total divided by count. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, `average` will be undefined.**
