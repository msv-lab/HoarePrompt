According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less and `num` is the popped integer value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', without affecting `total` or `count. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list should still have at least one element left.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left; `num` is the popped integer value.**
