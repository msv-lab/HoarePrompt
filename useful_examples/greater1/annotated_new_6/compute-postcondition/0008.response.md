Example Answer: 
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. Since the list `numbers` has at least one element, `num` will be assigned the value of the last element in the list, and that element will be removed from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less; `num` is the popped integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less; `num` is the popped integer value**
