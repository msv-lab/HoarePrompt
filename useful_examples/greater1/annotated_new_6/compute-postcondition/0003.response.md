Example Answer: 
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, which holds the removed integer value. The previous values are `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value. After execution, `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
