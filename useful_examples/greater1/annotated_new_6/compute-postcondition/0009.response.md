Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The value of `num` is popped from the `numbers` list. Therefore, the `total` is increased by the value of `num` that was popped from the `numbers` list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less; `num` is the popped integer value, `total` is increased by the value of `num`**
