Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less; `num` is the popped integer value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', without affecting `total` or `count`.***
