Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. The variable `num` is the popped integer value from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` has at least one element less after popping `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less**
