Example Answer:
The value of `num` is popped from the list `numbers` and added to the `total`. The `total` is increased by the value of `num`. The list `numbers` now has one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left; `num` is the popped integer value, `total` is increased by `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left; `num` is the popped integer value, `total` is increased by `num`**
