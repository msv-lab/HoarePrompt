Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value. If `num` is not greater than 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value. In this case, the program also prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value stored in `num`.***
