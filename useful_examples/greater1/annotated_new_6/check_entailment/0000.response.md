Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description for finding the average of positive integers in a list. It correctly initializes `total` and `count` to 0, then iterates through the list of numbers, adding up the positive integers greater than 1 to `total` and incrementing `count`. If there are no positive integers greater than 1, it returns `None`. Finally, it calculates the average by dividing the total sum by the count and returns it. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the program's logic and how it handles different scenarios, which align with the problem description. There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
