Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly follow the problem description because it only considers integers greater than 1 as positive numbers. However, the problem description asks to find the average of all positive integers in the list, which includes 1.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the program will skip the number 1 and calculate the average of only 2 and 3, which is incorrect. The correct average should include the number 1 as well.

The program should be modified to include all positive integers, including 1, in the calculation of the average.
