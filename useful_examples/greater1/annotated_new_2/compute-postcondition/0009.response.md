Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the current value of `total`. The value of `total` changes based on the last element `num`. The value of `count` remains the same as it is not mentioned to be updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has at least one element left, `total` is updated based on the last element `num`, `count` may or may not be updated.
Output State: **`numbers` has at least one element left, `total` is updated based on the last element `num`, `count` may or may not be updated**
