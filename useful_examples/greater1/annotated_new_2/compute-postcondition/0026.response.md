Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, calculating the sum of all numbers greater than 1 and the count of such numbers. If the list is empty, it sets `total` and `count` to 0. If any element in the list is non-positive, a message is printed. If the count of numbers greater than 1 is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, it computes the average of the numbers greater than 1 by dividing the total by the count. The function handles cases of non-positive elements in the list and an empty list correctly.**
