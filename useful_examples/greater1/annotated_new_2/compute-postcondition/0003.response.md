Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, and `total` is increased by the value of `num`. The previous value of `total` was 0, and the previous value of `num` was the last element of the list. Since `num` is added to `total`, the new value of `total` will be the sum of its previous value and the last element of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has the last element removed, `total` is the sum of its previous value and the last element of the list, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element of the list.
Output State: **`numbers` has the last element removed, `total` is the sum of its previous value and the last element of the list, `count` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list**
