Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The variable `num` holds the removed element, and the `total` is increased by the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the removed element, and `total` is incremented by the value of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the removed element, `total` is incremented by the value of `num`**
