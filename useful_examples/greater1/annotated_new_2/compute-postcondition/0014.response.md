Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. Since `numbers` had at least one element left, `num` now holds the value of the removed element. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the removed element.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the removed element**
