Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the last element of the `numbers` list due to the `pop()` method, which removes and returns the last element of the list. The `total` and `count` variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element of the list.
Output State: **`numbers` has the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element of the list**
