Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` has at least one element left, `total` is updated based on the last element `num`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` has at least one element left, `total` is updated based on the last element `num`, `count` is incremented by 1**
