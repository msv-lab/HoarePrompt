Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`, which is the integer popped from the list. The variables `numbers`, `total`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and no specific value is mentioned for `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
