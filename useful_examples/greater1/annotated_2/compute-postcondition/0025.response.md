The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If `numbers` is not empty, the function will iterate through the list, popping each element and performing specific operations based on the value of the popped integer. If the popped integer is greater than 1, the function will update `total` as the sum of all popped integers, `count` as the number of elements greater than 1, and print a message for each non-positive integer. If the popped integer is less than or equal to 1, `total` and `count` will be updated accordingly. After the loop finishes, if `count` is not 0, the function will calculate the average of all popped integers greater than 1. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total`, `count`, and `average` will all be 0.

Case_2: The functionality is identical to Case_1, but in the end, the function will return the calculated average.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list, perform specific operations based on the values of the integers, and return the calculated average. If the list is empty from the start, the function will return None.
