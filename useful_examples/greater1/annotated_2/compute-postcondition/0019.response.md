According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `numbers`. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, so it needs to have at least one element for the loop to execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 3 if num > 1 and 2 if num <= 1. If num is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, and `count` is set to 2. In either case, if num is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.**
