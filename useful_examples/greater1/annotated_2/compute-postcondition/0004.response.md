Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers, `count` is 1, `num` is the integer popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers, `count` is 1, `num` is the integer popped from the list**
