According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `numbers` has one less element, you need to ensure that `numbers` is not empty after removing one element.
2. If `num > 1`, `count` should be 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `count` should be 1.
3. If `num` is non-positive, a message is printed but the state of the variables remains unchanged.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 2 if num > 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` remains a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 2 if num > 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` remains a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 1. In case num is non-positive, a message is printed but the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
