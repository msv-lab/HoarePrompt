Correctness: **True**

The code accurately calculates the average of positive integers in a list as described in the problem description. It iterates through the list, skipping non-positive numbers, and calculates the sum of positive integers and the count of such numbers to compute the average. The annotations also align with the code logic and describe the program's behavior accurately. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
