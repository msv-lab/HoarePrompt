Output State: **If the initial numbers list is empty, total, count, and num remain unchanged. If there are elements in the initial numbers list, total contains the sum of all elements greater than 1, count holds the number of elements greater than 1, and num holds the last popped integer. If num is greater than 1, total is increased by num and count is incremented by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. After the loop finishes, numbers is an empty list. If count is 0, the function returns None. If count is not 0, the function returns the average calculated as total divided by count.**
