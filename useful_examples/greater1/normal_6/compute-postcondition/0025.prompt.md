You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: numbers is a list of integers.**
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Output: Case_1: *If numbers initially has elements, the loop will execute until numbers is empty. After the loop finishes, numbers will be an empty list, total will contain the sum of all elements in the initial numbers list that are greater than 1, count will hold the number of elements in the initial numbers list that are greater than 1, and num will hold the last popped integer. If num is greater than 1, total will be increased by num and count will be incremented by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, the program will print 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If the initial numbers list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the values of total, count, and num will remain unchanged. In the if part, if count is 0, the function returns None. In the else part, if count is not 0, average is calculated as total divided by count.

Case_2: If the initial numbers list is empty, total, count, and num remain unchanged. If there are elements in the initial numbers list, total contains the sum of all elements greater than 1, count holds the number of elements greater than 1, and num holds the last popped integer. If num is greater than 1, total is increased by num and count is incremented by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. After the loop finishes, numbers is an empty list. If count is 0, the function returns None. If count is not 0, the function returns the average calculated as total divided by count.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
