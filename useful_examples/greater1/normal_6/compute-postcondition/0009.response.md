Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the value of `total`. The previous values of the variables are `numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer. After the addition, the new value of `total` will be the previous value of `total` plus the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 plus the value of `num`, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 plus the value of `num`, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer**
