Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. The original list `numbers` will have one less element after popping. The value of `total` and `count` remain the same. 
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the popped integer**
