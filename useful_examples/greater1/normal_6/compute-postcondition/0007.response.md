According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is described as follows:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element
- `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1
- `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1
- `num` is the last popped integer

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last popped integer `num` is greater than 1, then `total` needs to be increased by `num` and `count` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If the last popped integer `num` is less than or equal to 1, then no adjustments need to be made to `total` and `count`, but the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' needs to be printed.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer.**
