Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the updated value of `count` is `count + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 plus the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `num` is the last popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 plus the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `num` is the last popped integer**
