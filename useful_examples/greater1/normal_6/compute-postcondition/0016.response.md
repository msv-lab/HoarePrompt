Example Answer:
The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `numbers`, `num`, and `total` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list, `total` is updated with the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list, `total` is updated with the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1**
