According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` still has elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration:
- `numbers` has one less element.
- `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 plus the value of `num` if `num` is greater than 1.
- `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` is greater than 1.
- If `num` is not greater than 1:
  - `numbers` has one less element.
  - `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1.
  - `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1.
  - `num` is the last popped integer.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last `num` is greater than 1, adjust `numbers` to have one more element.
- If the last `num` is greater than 1, adjust `total` to include the value of the last `num`.
- If the last `num` is greater than 1, adjust `count` to increment by 1.
- If the last `num` is not greater than 1, adjust `numbers` to have one more element.
- If the last `num` is not greater than 1, adjust `total` to exclude the value of the last `num`.
- If the last `num` is not greater than 1, adjust `count` to remain the same.

State: **Adjust the states based on the above conditions**
