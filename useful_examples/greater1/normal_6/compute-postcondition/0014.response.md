Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. The value of `num` depends on the original content of the `numbers` list. If `numbers` initially contained [1, 2, 3], and after popping the last element, `numbers` becomes [1, 2], then `num` would be 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list**
