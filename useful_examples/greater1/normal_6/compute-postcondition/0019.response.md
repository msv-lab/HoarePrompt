According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the `numbers` list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, and `num` holds the value popped from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the `numbers` list is not empty. Since the `numbers` list was updated based on the pop operation, we need to make sure that there are still elements left in the list after the pop operation. Additionally, if `num` was greater than 1 in the previous iteration, the `total` should be updated accordingly.

State: **`numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.**
