Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The description states that the function should find the average of the positive integers in the list and return None if the list is empty. However, the code only checks if the integer is greater than 1, which might exclude positive integers that are equal to 1. This means that the code might not handle the case where the list contains positive integers that are equal to 1, resulting in an incorrect average calculation. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as per the problem description.
