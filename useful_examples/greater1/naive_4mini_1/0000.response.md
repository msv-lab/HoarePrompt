Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the average of positive integers in a list. However, it contains a logical error in the condition that checks for positive integers. The condition `if num > 1` only counts numbers greater than 1 as positive, which means it will skip the number 1. Therefore, the program will not consider 1 as a positive integer, and if the list only contains the number 1 or any positive integers less than or equal to 1, it will return `None` instead of the correct average.

For example, if the input list is `[1]`, the function will skip this number and return `None`, even though the average of the positive integers should be `1`. This demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the requirement of finding the average of all positive integers.
