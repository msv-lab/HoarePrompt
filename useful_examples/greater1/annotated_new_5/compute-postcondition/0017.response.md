The code prints the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' where num is the popped integer. The variables `numbers` is a list of integers with reduced size as one element is popped, `num` is the popped integer, and `total` and `count` remain adjusted accordingly. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with reduced size, `num` is the popped integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly**
