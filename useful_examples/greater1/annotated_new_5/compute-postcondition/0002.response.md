Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list has one less element, and `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
