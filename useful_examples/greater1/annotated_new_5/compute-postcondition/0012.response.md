Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `num` is the popped integer from the list. If the popped integer is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If the popped integer is less than or equal to 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`, `total` remains 0, and `count` remains 0.***
