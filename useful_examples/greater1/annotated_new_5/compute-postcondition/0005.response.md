Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. The variables `numbers`, `total`, and `count` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
