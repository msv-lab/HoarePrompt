Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, summing up all numbers greater than 1 to `total` and counting the number of such elements to `count`. If a number less than or equal to 1 is encountered, a message is printed. After the loop finishes, if `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the numbers greater than 1 and returns it. If the initial list `numbers` is empty, the function returns None.**
