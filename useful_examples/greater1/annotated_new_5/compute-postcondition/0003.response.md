Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by each element `num` in the `numbers` list. The previous values of `numbers`, `total`, and `count` are known. After execution, `total` will be the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `count` is 0**
