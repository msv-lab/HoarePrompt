Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `num` which is popped from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list has a reduced size, and `num` is the popped integer. Therefore, after execution, the `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly based on the new value of `total`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with reduced size, `num` is the popped integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly**
