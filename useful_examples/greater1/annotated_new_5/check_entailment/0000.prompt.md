You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    total = 0
    #State of the program here: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0
    while numbers:
        num = numbers.pop()
        
        if num > 1:
            total += num
            count += 1
        else:
            print('Skipping non-positive number:', num)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0.
    if (count == 0) :
        return None
        #State of the program after the return statement: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0. The function returns None.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0. The function returns None.
    else :
        average = total / count
        #State of the program here: Output State: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0. Lastly, the variable 'average' will be calculated as the division of 'total' by 'count'.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: Output State: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0. Lastly, the variable 'average' will be calculated as the division of 'total' by 'count'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0. The function returns None if 'count' is 0. Otherwise, the variable 'average' will be calculated as the division of 'total' by 'count'.
    return average
    #State of the program after the return statement: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0. The function returns None if 'count' is 0. Otherwise, the variable 'average' will be calculated as the division of 'total' by 'count'.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, summing up all numbers greater than 1 to `total` and counting the number of such elements to `count`. If a number less than or equal to 1 is encountered, a message is printed. After the loop finishes, if `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the numbers greater than 1 and returns it. If the initial list `numbers` is empty, the function returns None.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
