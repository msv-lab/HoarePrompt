Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program accurately calculates the average of positive integers in a given list. It iterates through the list, summing up the positive integers greater than 1 and counting them to calculate the average. If all numbers in the list are less than or equal to 1, it correctly skips them and returns None. The annotations also align with the problem description, providing additional clarity on how the program operates. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
