Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped, using the value of `num` which is the last element popped from the list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element; `num` is the last element popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element; `num` is the last element popped from the list**
