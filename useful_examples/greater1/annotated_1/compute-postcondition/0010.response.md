Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element, `total` is incremented by the value of the last element popped from the list, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element, `total` is incremented by the value of the last element popped from the list, `count` is incremented by 1**
