Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of the removed element, `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, the last element is removed from the list, and `count` is increased by 1. If the last element is removed due to `num` not being greater than 1, then the total sum and count of the elements in the list are updated accordingly.***
