Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The values of `numbers`, `total`, and `num` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one element removed, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 1, `num` is the popped integer**
