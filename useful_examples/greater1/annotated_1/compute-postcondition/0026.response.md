Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, processes the elements by summing and counting those greater than 1, and calculates the average of those elements. If the initial `numbers` list is not empty, it iterates through all elements, updating `total` and `count` accordingly. If all elements are less than or equal to 1, it prints a message for each element. If the list is empty, no processing occurs. If `count` is 0 at the end, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the calculated average of elements greater than 1. **
