The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1: If the initial `numbers` list is not empty, the function will process all elements in the list. If any elements are greater than 1, it will calculate the sum of those elements as `total`, count the number of elements greater than 1 as `count`, and then empty the `numbers` list. If all elements are less than or equal to 1, it will print a message for each element and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If the initial `numbers` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. After processing the elements, if `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, it will calculate the average of elements greater than 1 and return it.

Case 2: Similar to Case 1, if the initial `numbers` list is not empty, the function will process all elements in the list. If any elements are greater than 1, it will calculate the sum of those elements as `total`, count the number of elements greater than 1 as `count`, and then empty the `numbers` list. If all elements are less than or equal to 1, it will print a message for each element and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If the initial `numbers` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. After processing the elements, if `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, it will calculate the average of elements greater than 1 and return it.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, process the elements to calculate the sum, count, and average of elements greater than 1, and return the average if count is greater than 0. If count is 0, it will return None.
