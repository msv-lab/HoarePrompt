Postcondition: ***If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop iterates, removing the last element each time. If the removed number is greater than 1, 'total' is incremented by that number and 'count' is increased by 1. If the removed number is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed about skipping a non-positive number. After iterating through all numbers, 'numbers' becomes empty, 'total' is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, and 'count' is the count of such numbers. If 'numbers' is initially empty, 'total' and 'count' remain 0. In the else part, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, 'count' is the count of such numbers, and 'average' is calculated as the total divided by count.***
