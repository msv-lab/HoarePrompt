According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are numbers left in the list. The condition for updating the total and count is whether the number is greater than 1 or not. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
State: **total is 15, count is 3**

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next number in the list:
- If the next number is greater than 1, then total should be updated by adding the number and count should be increased by 1.
- If the next number is less than or equal to 1, then a message stating that a non-positive number is skipped should be printed.

No other states need to be adjusted.
