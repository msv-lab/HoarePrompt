Output State: **If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to iterate. For each iteration, the last element is removed from 'numbers'. If the removed number is greater than 1, 'total' is incremented by the number and 'count' is increased by 1. If the removed number is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating the skipping of a non-positive number. The loop continues until all numbers in the list have been processed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be empty, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, and 'count' will be the count of numbers greater than 1 that were removed. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the loop will not execute and 'total' and 'count' will remain 0.**
