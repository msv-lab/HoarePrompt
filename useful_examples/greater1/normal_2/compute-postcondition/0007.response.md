According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, the last element has been removed, and the state of the variables is based on whether the last element `num` was greater than 1. 

If num was greater than 1, total is the sum of all the removed elements and count is 1. If num was not greater than 1, total remains 0, and count remains 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If num was greater than 1, total should be updated to include the sum of all the removed elements and count should be updated to 1.
- If num was not greater than 1, total and count should remain unchanged.

State: **numbers have the last element removed. If num is greater than 1, total is updated with the sum of all removed elements, count is updated to 1. If num is not greater than 1, total and count remain unchanged.**
