According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are numbers in the list. Whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable num. If num is greater than 1, total is increased by num and count is increased by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, the program skips the non-positive number and does not update total or count.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more number in the list that can affect the total and count based on the conditions given.

State: **Adjust based on the next number in the list and whether it satisfies the condition for updating total and count**
