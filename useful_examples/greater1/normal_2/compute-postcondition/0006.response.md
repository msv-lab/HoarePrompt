Postcondition: ***numbers have the last element removed. If num is greater than 1, total is the sum of all the removed elements, count is 1. If num is not greater than 1, total remains 0, count remains 0. In both cases, the program either updates the total and count variables based on the condition or prints a message stating the skipping of a non-positive number.***
