The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 
The function iterates through the list, removing the last element each time. If the removed number is greater than 1, it increments the `total` by that number and increases the `count` by 1. If the removed number is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed about skipping a non-positive number. After iterating through all numbers, if `numbers` is not empty, it calculates the average of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed and returns it. If `numbers` is initially empty, the function returns None.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate the average of numbers greater than 1 in the input list `numbers`, while handling cases where the list is initially empty or contains only non-positive numbers.
