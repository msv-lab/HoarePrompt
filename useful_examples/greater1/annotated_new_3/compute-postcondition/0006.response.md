Postcondition: ***numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the list where each element is greater than 1, count is the number of elements in the list that are greater than 1 plus 1, and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, total is incremented by `num` and count is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed, and total remains 0 while count remains the same as the initial value.***
