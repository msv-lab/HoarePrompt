Example Answer: 
The value `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. The list `numbers` will have one less element after `pop()` is executed. The value of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list**
