The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function performs the following operations based on the input list:
- If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the function calculates the sum of all elements greater than 1 and stores it in 'total', counts the number of elements greater than 1 and stores it in 'count', and removes the last integer from the list and stores it in 'num'. If 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' is increased by 'num' and 'count' is incremented by 1. If 'num' is not greater than 1, elements are removed until a non-positive number is encountered, with the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' contains the sum of all elements greater than 1, 'count' is the number of elements greater than 1, and 'num' is the last integer removed from the list. If 'numbers' is initially empty, 'total' and 'count' remain 0, and the loop does not execute. If 'count' is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if 'numbers' is not empty, the function calculates the average of all elements greater than 1 and returns it.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers 'numbers', perform the described operations, and return the calculated average if the list is not empty and 'count' is not 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers 'numbers', calculates the sum of elements greater than 1, counts the number of such elements, and calculates the average if applicable.**
