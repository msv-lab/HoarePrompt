According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with either the same number of elements or one less element. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the list `numbers` should have at least one element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **numbers is a list of integers with either the same number of elements or one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the updated list where each element is greater than 1, count is the number of elements in the updated list that are greater than 1 plus 1, and num is either the integer that was removed from the list or the non-positive number that was skipped.**
