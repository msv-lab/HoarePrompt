Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations suggest that the code will only consider positive integers greater than 1, but the problem description states that the program should find the average of positive integers in the list. This means that the code should also consider positive integers equal to 1. However, the code only checks if the integer is greater than 1, so it misses the case where the integer is exactly 1. This inconsistency between the annotations and the problem description makes the code incorrect.
