Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the last removed element, `count` is 1, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the last removed element, `count` is 1, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list**
