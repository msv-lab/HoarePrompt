Output State: **`numbers` list is not empty, `num` is the last element removed from `numbers`, if `num` is greater than 1 then `total` is the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements greater than 1, `numbers` has the last element removed. If `num` is 1 or less, `total` and `count` remain the same, `numbers` has the last element removed, and a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. If `numbers` list is initially empty, `total` and `count` remain 0. `average` is calculated as total divided by count.**
