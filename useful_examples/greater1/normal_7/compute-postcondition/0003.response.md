Example Answer: 
`total` is increased by the value of `num`, and `num` is the last element removed from the list, so `total` is incremented by that value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the last removed element, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the last removed element, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list**
