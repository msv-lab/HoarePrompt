Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `num` is added to `total`, `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`num` is added to `total`, `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value, `count` is increased by 1**
