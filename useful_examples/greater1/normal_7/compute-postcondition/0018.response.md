Postcondition: ***`num` is the value popped from the `numbers` list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` is reassigned the next value popped from the `numbers` list. If `num` is 1 or less, `num` is reassigned the next value popped from the `numbers` list and a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In both cases, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value.***
