According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of the `numbers` list. If the `numbers` list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the value popped from the `numbers` list.
To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. If `num` is greater than 1, `num` must be reassigned the next value popped from the `numbers` list.
2. If `num` is 1 or less, `num` must be reassigned the next value popped from the `numbers` list and a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' must be printed.
3. `total` must be increased by the value of `num` if `num` is greater than 1.
4. `count` must be increased by 1 if `num` is greater than 1.
5. The `numbers` list must be updated after popping the value.

State: **`num` is the value popped from the `numbers` list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` is reassigned the next value popped from the `numbers` list. If `num` is 1 or less, `num` is reassigned the next value popped from the `numbers` list and a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In both cases, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value.**
