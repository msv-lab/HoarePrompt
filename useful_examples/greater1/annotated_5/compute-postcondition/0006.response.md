Postcondition: ***`numbers` is [1, 2], `total` is either 3 with `count` being 1 or 0 with `count` being 0, depending on whether `num` is greater than 1 or not. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, 'Skipping non-positive number:' is printed for `num`.***
