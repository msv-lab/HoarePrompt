Example Answer: 
The value `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. The list `numbers` will have one less element. If the list `numbers` was initially `[1, 2, 3]`, after running the code, `num` will be the value of the last element (3), `total` and `count` will remain unchanged, and `numbers` will become `[1, 2]`.
Output State: **`numbers` is [1, 2], `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is 3**
