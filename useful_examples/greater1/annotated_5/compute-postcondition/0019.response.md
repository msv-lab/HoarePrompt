According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to `numbers` is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is not empty, `total` can be either 4 or 3 with `count` being 2 or 1 respectively if `num` is greater than 1. If `num` is 1 and not greater than 1, then `total` can be either 3 or 0 with `count` being 1 or 0 respectively after the execution of the if-else block**
