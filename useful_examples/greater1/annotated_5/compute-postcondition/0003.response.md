Example Answer:
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `num`, where `num` is 3. The previous value of `total` is 0, so after execution, `total` becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is [1, 2], `total` is 3, `count` is 0, `num` is 3.
Output State: **`numbers` is [1, 2], `total` is 3, `count` is 0, `num` is 3**
