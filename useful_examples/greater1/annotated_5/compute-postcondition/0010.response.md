Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is either 1 or 0. Therefore, after execution, `count` will be either 2 or 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`numbers` is [1], `total` is 5 with `count` being 2 or 1, `num` is 2**
