Output State: **If `numbers` list contains at least one positive integer, the loop will execute and pop each element from the list. If the popped element is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all such elements, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If the popped element is less than or equal to 1, it will be skipped, and the message will be printed. If all elements in `numbers` are non-positive, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty.**
