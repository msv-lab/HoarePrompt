Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 0. After execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is [1, 2], `total` is 3, `count` is 1, `num` is 3.
Output State: **`numbers` is [1, 2], `total` is 3, `count` is 1, `num` is 3**
