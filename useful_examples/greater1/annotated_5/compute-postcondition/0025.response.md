The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If the list `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, the loop will execute and pop each element from the list. If the popped element is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all such elements, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If the popped element is less than or equal to 1, it will be skipped, and a message will be printed. If all elements in `numbers` are non-positive, the loop will not execute, and both `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, if the loop executes and elements are popped based on the conditions, `total` will be the sum of elements greater than 1, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If all elements are non-positive, `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty. The `average` will be calculated as `total / count`.

Case_2: If the list `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, the loop will execute, pop each element from the list, and calculate the average. If all elements are non-positive, the loop will not execute, and both `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers` and perform the described operations based on the conditions mentioned in Case_1 and Case_2.
