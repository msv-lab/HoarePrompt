Example Answer:
Adding the value of `num` which is 2 to the current value of `total`, the new value of `total` will be 5. The state of `numbers` remains [1], `count` remains either 1 or 0 depending on the initial value of `total`, and `num` is 2.
Output State: **`numbers` is [1], `total` is 5 with `count` being 1 or 0, `num` is 2**
