Functionality: The function func accepts a list of numbers, calculates the total sum of all numbers in the list, and returns a new list containing the ratios of each number to the total sum. However, the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which could lead to a division by zero error. Additionally, if any number in the input list is zero, it may cause a zero division error as well. It's important to note that the function correctly computes the ratios when the total sum is not zero.
