The function accepts a birthdate as a date object, calculates the age based on the birthdate and the current date, and returns the calculated age. However, the function does not account for cases where the birthdate is in the future compared to the current date, which could result in a negative age. It also does not handle cases where the birthdate is not a valid date.
