The program below is incorrect. Given the program, a description of the problem the program is intended to solve, and a description of the actual program's output, generate a counterexample test that demonstrates the discrepancy between the expected and the actual outputs. Explain how this test demonstrates the discrepancy. The provided incorrect program must fail this test. The test must import the tested function from the placeholder <module_name>.


Follow the format in these examples:

# Example 1


Problem description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.

Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output description: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Explanation: According to the output description, the function does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect. Thus, for the 'abba' it will return 2 ('bb' and 'abba'), while the expected output is 6 ('a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'bb' and 'abba').

Counterexample test (note the placeholder <module_name>):
```
from <module_name> import count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends

def test_count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends():
    assert count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends('abba') == 6
```


# Your task

Problem description: Find someones age based on their year of birth

Program:
```
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(birthdate):
    today = date.today()
    age = today.year - birthdate.year
    return age

```
Output description: The function accepts a birthdate as a date object, calculates the age based on the birthdate and the current date, and returns the calculated age. However, the function does not account for cases where the birthdate is in the future compared to the current date, which could result in a negative age. It also does not handle cases where the birthdate is not a valid date. 
 And the explanation of the output: 

Explanation: The given program does not handle cases where the birthdate is in the future compared to the current date, which could result in a negative age. Additionally, it does not check for invalid birthdates. These are potential cases where the program does not work as described in the problem statement.
