Counterexample test (note the placeholder <module_name>):
```
from <module_name> import calculate_age
from datetime import date

def test_calculate_age():
    # Future birthdate
    future_birthdate = date.today().replace(year=date.today().year + 1)
    assert calculate_age(future_birthdate) < 0

    # Invalid birthdate (February 30th)
    invalid_birthdate = date(date.today().year, 2, 30)
    assert calculate_age(invalid_birthdate) is None
``` 

In this example, the test cases include a future birthdate, which should result in a negative age since the birthdate is in the future compared to the current date. The program is expected to return a negative age in this case, but it does not handle this scenario. Additionally, an invalid birthdate of February 30th is provided, which is not a valid date. The program is expected to return None for this case, but it does not check for invalid birthdates. This test demonstrates the discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual output of the program.
