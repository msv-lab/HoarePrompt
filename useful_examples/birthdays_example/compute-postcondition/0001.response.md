Example Answer:
The variable `age` is assigned the result of subtracting the birth year from the current year. The birthdate and today variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: birthdate is a date object representing someone's birthdate; today is the current date, age is the calculated age based on the birthdate and today's year.
Output State: **birthdate is a date object representing someone's birthdate; today is the current date, age is the calculated age based on the birthdate and today's year**
