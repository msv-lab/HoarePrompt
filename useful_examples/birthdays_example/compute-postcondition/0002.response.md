Example Answer:
The function returns the value of `age`. The value of `age` is calculated based on the difference between the year of the current date (`today`) and the year of the birthdate. The values of `birthdate` and `today` are not changed during the execution, so the output state is birthdate is a date object representing someone's birthdate; today is the current date, age is the calculated age based on the birthdate and today's year, and the function returns the calculated age.
Output State: **birthdate is a date object representing someone's birthdate; today is the current date, age is the calculated age based on the birthdate and today's year, and the function returns the calculated age**
