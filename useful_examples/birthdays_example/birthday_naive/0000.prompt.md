You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: Find someones age based on their year of birth
Python Fucntion:
```
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(birthdate):
    today = date.today()
    age = today.year - birthdate.year
    return age

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
