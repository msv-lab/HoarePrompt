The function accepts a 2D list (square matrix) of integers and returns the sum of all elements along the primary diagonal and the secondary diagonal of the matrix. However, it counts the central element of the matrix twice if the size of the matrix (n) is odd, as it is included in both diagonals. Therefore, if the matrix size is odd, the total will be greater than the actual sum of unique diagonal elements.
