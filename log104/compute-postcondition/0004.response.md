The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. The variable `i` is still 0, and `n` must be greater than 0, which means `n - i - 1` will evaluate to a positive index. Therefore, `total` becomes `total + matrix[0][n - 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`total` is equal to `total + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is still 0**.
