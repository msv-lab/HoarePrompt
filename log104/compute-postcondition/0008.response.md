According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 after the increment. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`total` is equal to its previous value plus `matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
