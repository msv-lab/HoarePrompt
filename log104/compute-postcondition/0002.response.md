According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as it determines the number of iterations. The `matrix` being a 2D list of integers and `total` being 0 does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0, representing the first iteration.

State: **`total` is 0, `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
