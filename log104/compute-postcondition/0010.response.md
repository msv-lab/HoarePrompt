The variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, this means that the value being added is `matrix[2][n - 3]` (since `n - i - 1` equals `n - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`). The previous value of `total` is defined as `total` equals its previous value plus `matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2]`. 

After executing the code, the new value of `total` becomes:

```
total = previous_value + matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2] + matrix[2][n - 3]
```

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but `total` is now updated.

Output State: **`total` is equal to its previous value plus `matrix[1][1] + matrix[1][n - 2] + matrix[2][2] + matrix[2][n - 3]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
