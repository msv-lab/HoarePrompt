The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`. `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. After executing the function body, it returns the total, which is equal to the sum of all elements along the primary and secondary diagonals of the square matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a square matrix of integers and return the sum of the elements on both the primary and secondary diagonals. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a square matrix of integers and returns the sum of all elements along the primary and secondary diagonals of the matrix.**
