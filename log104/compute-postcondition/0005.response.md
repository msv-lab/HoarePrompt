According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`total` is equal to `total + matrix[0][n - 1]`, `matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
