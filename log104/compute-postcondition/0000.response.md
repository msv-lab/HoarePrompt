The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(matrix)`, which represents the number of rows in the square matrix. Since it's a square matrix, the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. Therefore, `n` will hold the value corresponding to the length of one side of the square matrix. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list (square matrix) of integers, `n` is the length of one side of the square matrix (number of rows or columns).**
