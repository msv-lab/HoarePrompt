The provided function `func_1(matrix)` calculates the sum of the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix. 

1. **Initial Assessment**: 
   - The function iterates over the range of the matrix dimension `n`, summing the elements at positions `matrix[i][i]` (the primary diagonal) and `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` (the secondary diagonal). 
   - While this approach works for even-sized matrices, it will double-count the center element when `n` is odd, resulting in an incorrect sum.

2. **Output Hints**: 
   - The output hints confirm that the code will return a sum that is greater than the actual sum of unique diagonal elements when the matrix size is odd because the center element is counted twice. This is indeed a valid situation and aligns with the function's logic.

Given this analysis, there is a clear edge case where the function fails to adhere to the problem description: when the matrix size is odd.

**Correctness: False**. 

The function does not correctly calculate the sum of unique diagonal elements in all cases, particularly when the matrix dimension is odd.
