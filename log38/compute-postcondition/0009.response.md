Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`. The initial values are `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0. After execution, `prev` becomes 0 and `curr` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 4**
