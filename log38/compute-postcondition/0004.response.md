According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `prev` is 0 and `curr` is 1. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` should start at 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 2**
