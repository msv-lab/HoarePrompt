Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr`, which is 1, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr`, which is 0. Therefore, after execution, `prev` becomes 1 and `curr` becomes 0. The value of `n` is not affected, so the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2**
