The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. 

Case_2: If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns the factorial of `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `curr`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `n` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns the factorial of `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `curr`.
