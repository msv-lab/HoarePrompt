According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2 and the loop is inclusive of the end value, the loop needs to execute one more time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` remains greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 3**
