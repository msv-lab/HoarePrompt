Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not compute the nth Fibonacci number as per the problem description. The code computes the product of all numbers from 1 to n instead of calculating the nth Fibonacci number. For example, if we input n = 5, the code will output 0 instead of the correct Fibonacci number which is 5. Therefore, the code does not align with the problem description and is incorrect.
