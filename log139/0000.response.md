Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly handles the transfer of funds between two accounts. It checks if the requested amount can be fully transferred from Account A to Account B. If Account A has sufficient funds, it subtracts the amount from Account A and adds it to Account B. If Account A does not have enough funds, it transfers the remaining balance from Account A to Account B and sets Account A's balance to 0. This ensures that the transfer respects the constraint of not over-drafting Account A.

Given the logic in the function, it appears to handle all cases correctly based on the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements.
