Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function that calculates the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in a list, resetting the product when a zero is encountered. However, the annotated program does not perform any multiplication or accumulation of products. Instead, it has conditional statements that return specific integers (0 or the second element of the list) based on the length of the list.

Here are the issues:

1. The function checks if the length of `my_list` is even and returns 0, which is irrelevant to the problem of calculating cumulative products.
2. It then checks if the length is at least 3 and again returns 0, which does not contribute to solving the problem.
3. Finally, it returns the second element of the list, which does not correspond to a cumulative product calculation.

In summary, the function does not perform any operations related to calculating products, does not handle zeros properly, and does not adhere to the problem requirements. Thus, it fails to implement the desired functionality correctly.
