The function accepts a list of integers, `my_list`. It returns 0 if the length of `my_list` is even or if the length is 3 or more. If the length of `my_list` is odd and less than 3, it returns the integer at index 1 of `my_list`, which is guaranteed to exist in this case. The function does not handle cases where `my_list` is empty, as it would lead to an IndexError if the length is less than 2.
