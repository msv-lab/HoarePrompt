#State of the program right berfore the function call: my_list is a list of integers, which may include zero or non-zero values.
def func_1(my_list):
    if (len(my_list) % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers, which may include zero or non-zero values, and the length of `my_list` is odd.
    if (len(my_list) >= 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`my_list` is a list of integers, which may include zero or non-zero values, and the length of `my_list` is odd and less than 3.
    return my_list[1]
    #The program returns the integer at index 1 of the list `my_list`, which is guaranteed to exist since the length of `my_list` is odd and less than 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `my_list`. It returns 0 if the length of `my_list` is even or if the length is 3 or more. If the length of `my_list` is odd and less than 3, it returns the integer at index 1 of `my_list`, which is guaranteed to exist in this case. The function does not handle cases where `my_list` is empty, as it would lead to an IndexError if the length is less than 2.
