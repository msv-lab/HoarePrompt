The variables `t`, `s`, and `x` are assigned values from the input, which are provided as space-separated integers. The initial state does not specify their values, so they remain undefined but are transformed into integers by the `map` function. The other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unaffected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10; `t`, `s`, `x` are input integers.**
