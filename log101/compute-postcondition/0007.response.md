Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `t`, `s`, and `x` from user input. It checks if the difference between `x` and `t` is either divisible by `s` or leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by `s`. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not take parameters `l`, `r`, or `k` as described in the annotations, and it does not return any value. **
