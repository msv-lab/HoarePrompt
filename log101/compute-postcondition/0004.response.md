The code snippet executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. This does not affect the values of any variables, and no variables are changed as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; `t`, `s`, `x` are input integers. The value of `(x - t) % s` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1. Printed output: 'NO'**
