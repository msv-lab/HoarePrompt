The function `func` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers with the constraint that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer with the constraint that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function's output is determined by the values of `l`, `r`, and `k`. However, the specific return values based on these parameters are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we can summarize the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l and r (both integers with 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18), and k (an integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The return value depends on the specific logic implemented in the function, which is not detailed in the provided information.**
