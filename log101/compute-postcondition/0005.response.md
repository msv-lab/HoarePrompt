Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; `t`, `s`, `x` are input integers. If the current value of `(x - t) % s` is either 0 or 1, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t) % s` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, the program prints 'NO'.***
