Given the following two postconditions for a Python function:

1. Expected Postcondition: A description of the state of the program that should hold after executing the given code.
2. Computed Postcondition: A description of the state of the program generated by a tool based on the provided precondition and code.

Your task is to determine whether these two postconditions are semantically relatively the same, meaning they describe a very similar logical program state or behavior. You do not need to check for exact wording, but their semantic meaning must align.

For your response, provide:

- SAME: **True or False** (True if they describe the same state semantically; False if not).
- REASON: **The reason why the postconditions are the same or not**.

Here are the two postconditions:

Expected Postcondition:  
input_string is a string. If input_string represents a valid non-zero integer, result is 100 / value. If input_string does not represent a valid integer, result is 'Invalid input'. If input_string respresents zero, result is 'Cannot divide by zero'.

Computed Postcondition:  
`input_string` is a string. If the input can be converted to an integer, the function will return the result of 100 divided by the integer value. If the input cannot be converted to an integer, the result is 'Invalid input'. If the integer value is 0, the result is 'Cannot divide by zero'.

Your Response: 

SAME: **True or False**  
REASON: **Explanation for the decision**
