Example Answer:
The value of `data[key]` is assigned to the variable `value`. The value of `key` is a string. Since the initial state of the dictionary `data` is not provided, the specific value of `value` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: key is a string.
Output State: **key is a string**
