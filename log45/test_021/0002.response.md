The program could raise a `KeyError` if the specified key is not found in the dictionary. If the key is found in the dictionary, the value corresponding to that key is assigned to the variable `value`. If the key is not found, the variable `value` is assigned the string 'Key not found'. 
Therefore: Output State: **key is a string. If the key is found in the dictionary, the function assigns the corresponding value to the variable `value`, otherwise, it assigns 'Key not found' to the variable `value`.**
