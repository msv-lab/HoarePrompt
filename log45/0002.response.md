SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program after execution. They both state that `numbers` is a list and `index` is an integer. They also agree that if the `index` is within the bounds of `numbers`, `value` takes the value at `numbers[index]`. Additionally, both postconditions handle the out-of-bounds scenario similarly: the expected postcondition mentions `value` is `None` if the index is out of bounds, while the computed postcondition describes the potential for an `IndexError` and subsequently, `value` being set to `None`. The essential semantic meaning is the same, addressing how `value` is determined based on the `index` validity.
