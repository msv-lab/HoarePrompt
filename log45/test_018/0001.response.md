Example Answer:
The `file` object is opened using the `filename` path, and the content of the file is read and stored in the variable `content`. If the file was successfully opened, `file` will contain the opened file object, and `content` will contain the content of the file. If there was an error opening the file, `file` will contain an error message. Therefore, the Output State is: `filename` is a string representing a valid file path; `file` is either the opened file object or an error if the file could not be opened; `content` is the content of the file if it was successfully read.
Output State: **`filename` is a string representing a valid file path; `file` is either the opened file object or an error if the file could not be opened; `content` is the content of the file if it was successfully read.**
