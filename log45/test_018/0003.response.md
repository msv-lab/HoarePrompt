A `FileNotFoundError` could occur if the file specified by `filename` does not exist. The `try` block attempts to open the file in read mode and read its contents. If the file is successfully opened, `file` contains the opened file object and `content` contains the content of the file. If a `FileNotFoundError` occurs, `content` is set to an empty string.
Therefore, Output State: **`filename` is a string representing a valid file path. If the file exists and can be opened, `file` contains the file object, and `content` contains the file content. If the file is not found, `content` is an empty string.**
