Example Answer:
The code opens the file specified by the `filename` in read mode ('r'). If the file exists and can be opened, it will be assigned to the variable `file`. If not, an error will be raised. The value of `filename` is already given as a valid file path string. Therefore, the Output State is: `filename` is a string representing a valid file path; `file` is either the opened file object or an error if the file could not be opened.
Output State: **`filename` is a string representing a valid file path; `file` is either the opened file object or an error if the file could not be opened**
