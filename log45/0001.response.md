SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical behavior of the program. They both specify that `input_string` is a string. When `input_string` represents a valid non-zero integer, the result is the division of 100 by the integer value. If `input_string` does not represent a valid integer, the result is 'Invalid input'. Lastly, if the integer value is zero, the result is 'Cannot divide by zero'. The semantic meaning of the expected and computed postconditions aligns perfectly, even though the wording is slightly different.
