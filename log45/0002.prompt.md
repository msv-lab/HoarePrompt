Given the following two postconditions for a Python function:

1. Expected Postcondition: A description of the state of the program that should hold after executing the given code.
2. Computed Postcondition: A description of the state of the program generated by a tool based on the provided precondition and code.

Your task is to determine whether these two postconditions are semantically relatively the same, meaning they describe a very similar logical program state or behavior. You do not need to check for exact wording, but their semantic meaning must align.

For your response, provide:

- SAME: **True or False** (True if they describe the same state semantically; False if not).
- REASON: **The reason why the postconditions are the same or not**.

Here are the two postconditions:

Expected Postcondition:  
numbers is a list, index is an integer. If index is within the bounds of numbers, value is numbers[index]. If index is out of bounds of the list numbers, value is None.

Computed Postcondition:  
The program could raise an `IndexError` if the index specified is out of range for the list `numbers`. If the index is within the valid range, the value at that index is assigned to `value`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `value` is set to `None`. 
Therefore, the output state is: **`numbers` is a list, `index` is an integer, `value` is assigned the value at the specified index from the list. If an `IndexError` occurs, `value` is `None`.**

Your Response: 

SAME: **True or False**  
REASON: **Explanation for the decision**
