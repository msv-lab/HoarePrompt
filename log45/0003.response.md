SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same semantic behavior of the program. They both state that `key` is a string and refer to a dictionary (`data`). If `key` exists in `data`, they both describe that `value` will be assigned `data[key]`. If `key` does not exist in the dictionary, `value` will be assigned the string 'Key not found'. Despite slight differences in wording, the logical outcomes and conditions described are equivalent.
