SAME: **True**

REASON: Both postconditions describe the state of the program in terms of handling a file given a filename. They both agree on the following points:
- `filename` is a string representing a valid file path.
- If the file exists, `content` contains the text of the file.
- If the file does not exist, `content` is an empty string.

The difference is that the Computed Postcondition introduces the concept of a `file` object being created if the file can be opened, which is an implementation detail not mentioned in the Expected Postcondition. However, this does not alter the semantic meaning of the postcondition related to the `content`, which is the primary focus of both descriptions. Therefore, they are semantically the same regarding the state of `content` after execution.
