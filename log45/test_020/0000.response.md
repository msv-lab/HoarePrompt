Example Answer:
The variable `value` is assigned the value at the index `index` from the list `numbers`. The values of `numbers` and `index` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `numbers` is a list, `index` is an integer, `value` is assigned the value at the specified index from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list, `index` is an integer, `value` is assigned the value at the specified index from the list**
