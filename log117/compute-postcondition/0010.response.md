According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is defined to run for `i` in the range from `1` to `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than `1`, as if `k` is `1`, the range would be empty and the loop would not execute. 

Since `dp[n, k]` is currently `9`, this means that the state of the dictionary is intact, and it is confirmed that the tuple `(n, k)` exists in `dp`. 

So for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than `1`, and the initial value of `i` should be `1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `k` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a dictionary that maps tuples of (n, k) to integers, and `dp[n, k]` is now 9, i is 1**
