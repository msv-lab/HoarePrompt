According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k - 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than `i`. 

Since `i` starts at `1` and is incremented by `1` each iteration, after the last iteration `i` would have reached `k - 1`. To execute one more time, `i` must now be `2` (the next integer). Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be at least `3` (which it is, since `k` is greater than `2`), and `i` must be `2`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is now updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10`**
