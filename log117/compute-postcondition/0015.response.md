The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated by the expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `i` is 2, we can substitute this into the expression:

1. The term `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `10 ** 1 = 10`.
2. The term `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.
3. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` do not change, but the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`**.
