The expression updates `dp[n, k]` by adding a calculated value to it. The term `(10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2))` simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 2)`, since `10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)` equals `10 ** (k - 2) * (10 - 1)`. 

Next, `n // 10 ** (k - 1)` calculates how many complete groups of `10 ** (k - 1)` fit into `n`, and subtracting 1 accounts for the range starting from 0.

Thus, the new value of `dp[n, k]` becomes:

```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
```

Since `n` is a non-negative integer less than `10^18` and `k` is a positive integer between 2 and 10, the terms within the operation will yield valid results. The state of `dp[n, k]` will reflect this update based on the previous accumulated value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer less than `10^18`, `k` is a positive integer between 2 and 10, and `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, `k` is a positive integer between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`**.
