The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10.
- `dp` is a dictionary that maps tuples of (n, k) to integers.

After executing the function body, it has multiple return cases:

- **Case 1**: The function returns `0`.
- **Case 2**: The function returns the value associated with the tuple `(n, k)` from the dictionary `dp`, provided `k` is not equal to `0`.
- **Case 3**: The function returns `dp[n, k]`, which is equal to `n` if `n` is less than \(10^k\); otherwise, it is updated based on previously defined conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `dp`, and return a value based on the specified conditions regarding `n` and `k`, including handling cases where the return is either `0`, a value from the dictionary, or the value of `n` based on its comparison to \(10^k\). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a non-negative integer less than 10^18), k (a positive integer between 1 and 10), and dp (a dictionary mapping tuples of (n, k) to integers), and it returns either 0, a value from the dictionary associated with (n, k), or n based on its comparison to 10^k.**
