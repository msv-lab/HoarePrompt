Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle the requirement that each number must contain at most `k` different digits. The function `func_2` has a condition to return `0` if `k` is `0`, but this is irrelevant since `k` is always at least `1` according to the problem description.

Furthermore, the logic in `func_2` does not account for the actual digits in the numbers from `l` to `r`. It contains a formula that may not accurately sum the numbers containing at most `k` different digits. As a result, the output for certain ranges may not correctly reflect the sum of the valid numbers.

For example, consider the input `l = 100`, `r = 110`, and `k = 2`. The valid numbers in this range are `100`, `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, `105`, `106`, `107`, `108`, `109`, and `110`, which all contain at most 2 different digits. The correct sum should be `100 + 101 + 102 + 103 + 104 + 105 + 106 + 107 + 108 + 109 + 110 = 1155`. However, the function's implementation may not produce this result since it does not explicitly check the digit composition of the numbers.

Thus, because the code fails to account for the condition of having at most `k` different digits for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed **False**.
