You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \\le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.\n\nFor example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \\le l \\le r < 10^{18}, 1 \\le k \\le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 50 2\n\nOutput\n1230\n\nInput\n1 2345 10\n\nOutput\n2750685\n\nInput\n101 154 2\n\nOutput\n2189\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\\frac{50 \\cdot 51}{2} - \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.\n\nFor the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\\frac{2345 \\cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.\n\nFor the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

Functions with output description for each function:
MOD = 998244353
(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18) and an integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 10). It calculates and returns the result of the expression (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. This effectively computes the difference between the results of func_2 for the upper bound `r` and the lower bound `l - 1`, applying the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the defined limits.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, k, dp):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if (n, k) in dp:
        return dp[n, k]
    if n < 10 ** k:
        dp[n, k] = n
    else:
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    return dp[n, k]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (less than 10^18), a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 10), and a dictionary `dp` that maps tuples of `(n, k)` to integers. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the value from the dictionary for `(n, k)` if it exists, or `n` if `n` is less than 10^k. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10^k, it calculates a value based on a formula involving `n` and updates `dp[n, k]` accordingly before returning this value. If none of these conditions are met, the function also handles the edge case of `k` being at its minimum value.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
