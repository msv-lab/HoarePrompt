The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18) and an integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 10). It calculates and returns the result of the expression (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. This effectively computes the difference between the results of func_2 for the upper bound `r` and the lower bound `l - 1`, applying the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the defined limits.
