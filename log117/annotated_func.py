def func_1(l, r, k):

    return (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the result of the expression (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where func_2 is called with parameters r, k, and dp for the upper bound, and l-1, k, and dp for the lower bound, using the given constraints for l, r, and k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18) and an integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 10). It calculates and returns the result of the expression (func_2(r, k, dp) - func_2(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. This effectively computes the difference between the results of func_2 for the upper bound `r` and the lower bound `l - 1`, applying the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the defined limits.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10. If `n` is less than 10^k, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, if `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `(dp[n, k] + 90) % MOD`.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value of dp[n, k], which is n if n is less than 10^k, otherwise it is updated based on the previously defined conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (less than 10^18), a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 10), and a dictionary `dp` that maps tuples of `(n, k)` to integers. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the value from the dictionary for `(n, k)` if it exists, or `n` if `n` is less than 10^k. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10^k, it calculates a value based on a formula involving `n` and updates `dp[n, k]` accordingly before returning this value. If none of these conditions are met, the function also handles the edge case of `k` being at its minimum value.
