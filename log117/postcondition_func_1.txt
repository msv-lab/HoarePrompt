The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (less than 10^18), a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 10), and a dictionary `dp` that maps tuples of `(n, k)` to integers. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the value from the dictionary for `(n, k)` if it exists, or `n` if `n` is less than 10^k. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10^k, it calculates a value based on a formula involving `n` and updates `dp[n, k]` accordingly before returning this value. If none of these conditions are met, the function also handles the edge case of `k` being at its minimum value.
