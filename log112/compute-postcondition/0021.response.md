The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).
- `dp` is a dictionary that maps tuples of `(n, k)` to integers.

After executing the function body, the output can be summarized as follows:

- Case 1: The function returns 0.
- Case 2: The function returns the value associated with the tuple `(n, k)` from the dictionary `dp`.
- Case 3: The function returns the value mapped to the key `(n, k)` in the dictionary `dp`. If `n` is less than \(10^{k}\), then `dp[n, k]` is equal to `n`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`, returning either 0, a value from the dictionary `dp`, or a computed value based on the conditions specified regarding `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\)), `k` (a positive integer between 1 and 10), and `dp` (a dictionary mapping tuples of (n, k) to integers), returning either 0, a value from `dp`, or a computed value based on the conditions involving `n` and `k`.**
