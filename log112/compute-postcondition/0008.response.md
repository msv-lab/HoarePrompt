Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a dictionary that maps tuples of (n, k) to integers, the tuple (n, k) is not in the dictionary `dp`, and `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\)***
