According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, `k` must be greater than 3, `dp[n, k]` is now 9 + 9 * 10 * (10^(k - 2) - 10), `i` is 3**
