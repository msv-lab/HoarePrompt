Output State: **The program returns the value mapped to the key (n, k) in the dictionary dp, where n is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\) and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. If n is less than \(10^{k}\), then dp[n, k] is equal to n. If k is greater than or equal to 2, then dp[n, k] is updated to dp[n, k] % MOD.**
