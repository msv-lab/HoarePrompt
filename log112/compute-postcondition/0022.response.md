Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (less than \(10^{18}\)), a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 10), and a dictionary `dp` that maps tuples of `(n, k)` to integers. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, or retrieves the value associated with the tuple `(n, k)` from `dp` if it exists. If `(n, k)` is not in `dp`, it calculates a value based on the comparison of `n` with \(10^k\) and updates `dp` accordingly. If `n` is less than \(10^k\), it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. Otherwise, it computes a value based on a specific formula and then reduces it modulo `MOD`, returning the final computed value stored in `dp[n, k]`. **
