To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18
- `k` must be greater than 3
- `dp[n, k]` is now \(9 + 9 \times 10 \times (10^{(k - 2)} - 10)\)
- `i` is 3

The code snippet is:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. The value of `i` is currently 3.
2. The term \(10^{(i - 1)}\) simplifies to \(10^{(3 - 1)} = 10^2 = 100\).
3. The term \(10^{(k - i)}\) simplifies to \(10^{(k - 3)}\).
4. Therefore, \(10^{(k - i)} - 10^{(i - 1)}\) becomes \(10^{(k - 3)} - 100\).
5. Thus, the expression for \(dp[n, k]\) after executing the code becomes:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 9 \times 100 \times (10^{(k - 3)} - 100) = 900 \times (10^{(k - 3)} - 100)
   \]

Now, we can summarize the changes:
- `dp[n, k]` is updated with the new calculated value of \(dp[n, k] + 900 \times (10^{(k - 3)} - 100)\).
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 10^18; `k` is greater than 3; `dp[n, k]` is now \(9 + 9 \times 10 \times (10^{(k - 2)} - 10) + 900 \times (10^{(k - 3)} - 100)\); `i` is 3.**
