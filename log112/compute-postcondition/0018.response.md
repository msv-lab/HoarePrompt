The operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[n, k]` to be the remainder when `dp[n, k]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is not specified, but we know it was updated by adding \(9 \times 10^{(k - 2)} \times (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)\). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2`, `dp[n, k]` is updated and is now equal to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2`, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.**
