Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `n` is less than \(10^{k}\), then `dp` now contains the key `(n, k)` mapped to the value `n`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.***
