According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `k - 1`. If `k` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and `i` will have taken on values starting from 1 up to `k - 1`. 

Since `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2. Given the range, if `i` is currently at 1, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[n, k]` is now 9 * (10, `i` is 2**
