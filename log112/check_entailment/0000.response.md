To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to examine whether the program accurately implements the required functionality.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Description**: The program should take three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`.
2. **Output Requirements**: The program must compute the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, and return this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of valid numbers between `l` and `r` by calling `func_2` for the upper bound `r` and lower bound `l - 1`. The purpose of this is to find the count of valid numbers within the specified range.
   - The result is adjusted with a modulo operation, which is appropriate given the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k, dp)`**:
   - This function appears to determine the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to the number `n`.
   - The function handles cases where `k` is `0` (returning zero, which is unnecessary for valid inputs since `k` will always be at least `1`).
   - It checks if the result for `(n, k)` is already computed and stored in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - When `n < 10**k`, it returns `n` directly, which is a crucial step as it correctly identifies all numbers less than `10**k` are valid.
   - The loop and subsequent calculations appear to be intended for counting numbers with specific digit constraints, but the exact logic for how it counts the valid numbers isn't fully detailed.

### Key Points of Concern:
- The logic for counting numbers with at most `k` different digits seems incomplete or not rigorously defined. It does not explicitly check each number in the range from `l` to `r` for the digit condition, which is a critical requirement of the problem.
- The program does not provide a clear mechanism for summing the individual valid numbers as stated in the problem, which requires summing each number directly if it meets the criteria.

### Conclusion:
The program does not directly check or sum the numbers between `l` and `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. Instead, it seems to focus on counting some form of valid digit combinations without explicitly verifying each number in the range.

Thus, the implementation does not satisfy the problem's requirements fully, as it fails to ensure that only the numbers that strictly meet the digit criteria are included in the sum.

Correctness: **False**
