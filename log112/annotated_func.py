#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 <= l <= r < 10^18` and `1 <= k <= 10`. It calculates and returns the result of the expression \((\text{func\_2}(r, k, dp) - \text{func\_2}(l - 1, k, dp)) \mod \text{MOD}\), leveraging a helper function `func_2` to perform the computation based on the given `l`, `r`, and `k`.

If `n` is less than \(10^{k}\), then `dp` now contains the key `(n, k)` mapped to the value `n`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value mapped to the key (n, k) in the dictionary dp, where n is a non-negative integer less than \(10^{18}\) and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. If n is less than \(10^{k}\), then dp[n, k] is equal to n. If k is greater than or equal to 2, then dp[n, k] is updated to dp[n, k] % MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (less than \(10^{18}\)), a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 10), and a dictionary `dp` that maps tuples of `(n, k)` to integers. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, or retrieves the value associated with the tuple `(n, k)` from `dp` if it exists. If `(n, k)` is not in `dp`, it calculates a value based on the comparison of `n` with \(10^k\) and updates `dp` accordingly. If `n` is less than \(10^k\), it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. Otherwise, it computes a value based on a specific formula and then reduces it modulo `MOD`, returning the final computed value stored in `dp[n, k]`.
