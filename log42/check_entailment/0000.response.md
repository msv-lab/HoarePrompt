Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. 

The issue lies within the while loop where the calculation of the Fibonacci numbers is incorrect. The line `prev, curr = curr, prev * curr` is not the correct way to calculate the next Fibonacci number. The correct calculation should be `prev, curr = curr, prev + curr`.

For example, if we call `func_1(2)`, the expected output should be 1 (as the 2nd Fibonacci number is 1), but the program will return 1 instead. This discrepancy shows that the program is not computing the Fibonacci numbers correctly.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
