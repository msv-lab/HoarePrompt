Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the n-th Fibonacci number. The logic inside the `while` loop is incorrect. It should be updating `prev` and `curr` by adding them together, not multiplying them. Additionally, the loop condition should be `i < n` instead of `i <= n`. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 2
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr
        i += 1
        
    return curr
```

This corrected version correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number for all non-negative integers `n`.
