#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer n
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 1, the program returns n. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev * curr
        
        i = i - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to the negative value of `n`, `prev` and `curr` hold values dependent on the initial value of `n`
    return curr
    #The program returns the value stored in 'curr'
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the value stored in 'curr' based on the Fibonacci sequence with initial values of prev = 0 and curr = 1. However, the current implementation of the function does not accurately update the Fibonacci sequence values within the while loop, resulting in an incorrect calculation. The function should be revised to correctly update the Fibonacci sequence values in each iteration of the loop to achieve the intended functionality.
