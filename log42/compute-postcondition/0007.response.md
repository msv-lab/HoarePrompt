According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 so that it is still less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2**
