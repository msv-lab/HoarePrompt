According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. In this case, `i` is -1 and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It needs to be increased by 1 to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**
