Example Answer: 
`i` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `i` is 0. After execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**
