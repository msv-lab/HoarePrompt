Example Answer:
The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables `n`, `prev`, and `curr` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0**
