The loop calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. The variables `prev` and `curr` are used to store the Fibonacci numbers while `i` is used as a loop control variable. After the loop finishes executing, `prev` will contain the Fibonacci number at index n, `curr` will contain the Fibonacci number at index n+1, and `i` will be equal to n+1.
Output State: **`prev` is the Fibonacci number at index n, `curr` is the Fibonacci number at index n+1, `i` is n+1**
