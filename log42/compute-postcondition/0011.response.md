Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the value stored in 'curr' based on the Fibonacci sequence with initial values of prev = 0 and curr = 1. However, the current implementation of the function does not accurately update the Fibonacci sequence values within the while loop, resulting in an incorrect calculation. The function should be revised to correctly update the Fibonacci sequence values in each iteration of the loop to achieve the intended functionality. **
