The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. In all other cases where `n` is greater than 1, there is no change to `n`. Additionally, the function returns the Fibonacci number at index n+1, which is stored in variable `curr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, and if `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns the Fibonacci number at index n+1.
