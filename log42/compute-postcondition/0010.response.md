The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. 

- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. 
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program returns the value stored in a variable called 'curr'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `n` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the value stored in the variable 'curr'.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. If n is greater than 1, it returns the value stored in 'curr'.**
