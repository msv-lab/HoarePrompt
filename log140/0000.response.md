Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `session['ref_count']` is greater than 1. According to the problem description, if `ref_count` is greater than 1, it should be decremented by 1 and `closed` should be set to `False`. However, the current implementation only handles the case where `ref_count` is exactly 1. For example, consider the following sessions dictionary:

```python
sessions = {
    'user1': {'ref_count': 2, 'closed': False},
}
```

When `func_1(sessions, 'user1')` is called, the program will decrement `ref_count` to 1 but will not set `closed` to `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
