The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns the updated value of `x` by increasing it by 1. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns the updated value of `x` by decreasing it by 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return the updated value of `x` after either increasing by 1 if `x` was greater than 0, or decreasing by 1 if `x` was less than or equal to 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns the updated value of x after either increasing by 1 if x was greater than 0, or decreasing by 1 if x was less than or equal to 0.**
