SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical outcomes for the variable `z` based on the values of `x` and `y`. In the expected postcondition, when `x == y`, `z` is described as the sum of `x` and `y`, which is logically equivalent to `2 * x` because `x` and `y` are equal. For the case when `x < y`, the expected postcondition states that `z` is the difference between `y` and `x`, which aligns with the computed postcondition stating `z` is a positive integer equal to `y - x`, as both describe the result of subtracting `x` from `y`. The computed postcondition includes an additional case for when `x` is not equal to `y` and `x` is less than or equal to `y`, which effectively covers the scenario where `x < y` because if `x > y`, this case would not apply. Therefore, semantically, both postconditions are describing the same state and behavior of the program.
