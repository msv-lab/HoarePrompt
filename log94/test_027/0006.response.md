`z` is assigned the value of `y - x`. Given that `x` is less than or equal to `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`, it means `y - x` will be a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `z` is a positive integer equal to `y - x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, `z` is a positive integer equal to `y - x`.**
