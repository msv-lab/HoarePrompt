`z` is assigned the value of `x + y`. Since it is stated that the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, we can represent this as `x = y`. Thus, `z` will be equal to `x + x`, which simplifies to `z = 2 * x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is equal to `2 * x`**
