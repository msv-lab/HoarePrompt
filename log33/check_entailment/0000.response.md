Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description. It iterates through the list, calculates the sum of numbers greater than 1, counts them, and computes the average of those numbers. If there are no numbers greater than 1, it returns None. The code annotations provide a clear explanation of how the program behaves in different scenarios, and based on the code and annotations, it can be concluded that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
