Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, loop will execute multiple times. After the loop finishes, `total` will be the sum of all numbers in the `numbers` list that are greater than 1, `count` will be the count of such numbers, and `numbers` will be an empty list. If all numbers in the `numbers` list are less than or equal to 1, `total` and `count` will remain 0, and `numbers` will be an empty list. If the initial `numbers` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and `total`, `count`, and `numbers` will remain unchanged.**
