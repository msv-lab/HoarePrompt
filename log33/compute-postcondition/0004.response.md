Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `num`. The initial state indicates that `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `num` holds the popped element which is greater than 1. After executing the code, `total` will be incremented by the value of `num`. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 0, `num` holds the popped element, and the value of `num` is greater than 1**
