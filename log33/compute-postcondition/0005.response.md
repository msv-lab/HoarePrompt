Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 1, `num` holds the popped element, and the value of `num` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 1, `num` holds the popped element, and the value of `num` is greater than 1**
