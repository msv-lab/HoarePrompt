According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must not be empty.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. `num` holds the popped element. If `num` > 1, `total` is updated by adding `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, or `numbers` is not empty, no changes are made to `total` and `count`. If `num` > 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, or `numbers` is not empty, `total` and `count` remain unchanged. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.**
