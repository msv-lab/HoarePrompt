Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. The last element is removed from the list. The previous values of `numbers` contain a list of integers, `total` is 0, and `count` is 0. After execution, `num` holds the value of the popped element, and that element is removed from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the popped element.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the popped element**
