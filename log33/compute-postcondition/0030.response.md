Output State: **If `numbers` had values greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of those values, `count` will be the count of such values, and `numbers` will be an empty list. The `average` will be calculated as `total / count`. If all numbers in the `numbers` list were less than or equal to 1, `total` and `count` will remain 0, and `numbers` will be an empty list. If the initial `numbers` list was empty, `total`, `count`, and `numbers` will remain unchanged.**
