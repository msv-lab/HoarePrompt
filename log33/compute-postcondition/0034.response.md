Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It iterates through the list, calculates the sum of numbers greater than 1, counts them, and then computes the average of those numbers. If there are no numbers greater than 1, it returns None. If the initial list is empty, it returns None as well. The function modifies the `numbers` list during execution based on the conditions met.**
