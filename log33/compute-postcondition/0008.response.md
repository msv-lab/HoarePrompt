Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated to the sum of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the popped element. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number:', and `total`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
