According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated to the sum of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the popped element. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number:', and `total`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must not be empty.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `num` holds the popped element, `total` is updated according to the conditions, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` is less than or equal to 1 or `numbers` is not empty**
