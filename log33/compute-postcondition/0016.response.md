Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. `num` holds the popped element. If `num` > 1, `total` is updated by adding `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, or `numbers` is not empty, no changes are made to `total` and `count`. If `num` is greater than 1, the function skips the non-positive number and prints a message.***
