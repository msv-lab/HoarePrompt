The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If the count is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if there are numbers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, `total` will be the sum of those values, `count` will be the count of such values, `average` will be calculated as `total / count`, and `numbers` will become an empty list. If all numbers in the initial `numbers` list are less than or equal to 1, `total` and `count` will remain 0, `average` will be undefined, and `numbers` will be an empty list. If the initial `numbers` list is empty, `total`, `count`, and `numbers` will remain unchanged.

Case_2: The program returns the average of numbers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list or None if no such numbers exist.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers` and perform calculations based on the given conditions to determine the total, count, average, and modify the `numbers` list accordingly. It also returns the average of numbers greater than 1 or None if no such numbers exist.
