Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the average of the positive integers in a list, but the program only considers numbers greater than 1 as positive integers. This means that the number 1 is not considered as a positive integer, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the program will skip the number 1 and calculate the average of 2 and 3, which is 2.5. However, the correct average of the positive integers in the list should be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
