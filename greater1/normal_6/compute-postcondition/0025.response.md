The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1: If the `numbers` list initially has elements, the function will iterate through the list until it is empty. After the loop finishes, the `numbers` list will be empty, `total` will contain the sum of all elements in the initial `numbers` list that are greater than 1, `count` will hold the number of elements in the initial `numbers` list that are greater than 1, and `num` will hold the last popped integer. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be increased by `num` and `count` will be incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function will print 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If the initial `numbers` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the values of `total`, `count`, and `num` will remain unchanged. In the case where `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `count` is not 0, the function calculates the average as `total` divided by `count`.

Case 2: If the initial `numbers` list is empty, the values of `total`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged. If there are elements in the initial `numbers` list, `total` contains the sum of all elements greater than 1, `count` holds the number of elements greater than 1, and `num` holds the last popped integer. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. After the loop finishes, the `numbers` list is empty. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. If `count` is not 0, the function returns the average calculated as `total` divided by `count`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list, perform specific operations based on the values of the elements, and return either None or the average of elements greater than 1 in the list.
