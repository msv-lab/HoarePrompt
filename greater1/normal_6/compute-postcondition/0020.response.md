Output State: **If numbers initially has elements, the loop will execute until numbers is empty. After the loop finishes, numbers will be an empty list, total will contain the sum of all elements in the initial numbers list that are greater than 1, count will hold the number of elements in the initial numbers list that are greater than 1, and num will hold the last popped integer. If num is greater than 1, total will be increased by num and count will be incremented by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, the program will print 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If the initial numbers list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the values of total, count, and num will remain unchanged.**
