Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to `total`, so `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The previous values of `total`, `count`, and `numbers` are unknown, but `num` is the popped integer from `numbers`. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated with the addition of `num`, count is 0, and num is the popped integer.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is updated with the addition of `num`, count is 0, and num is the popped integer**
