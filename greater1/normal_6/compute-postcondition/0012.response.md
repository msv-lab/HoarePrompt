Postcondition: ***`numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1 plus the value of `num` if `num` is greater than 1, `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` is greater than 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, `numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer.***
