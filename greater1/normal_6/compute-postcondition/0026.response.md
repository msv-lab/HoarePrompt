Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, iterates through the list, and calculates the sum of elements greater than 1 along with the count of such elements. If there are elements in the list, the function returns the average of the elements greater than 1. If the list is empty or no elements are greater than 1, the function returns None. The code also prints a message for elements less than or equal to 1 during the iteration.**
