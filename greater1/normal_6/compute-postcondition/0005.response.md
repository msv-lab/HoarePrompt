Example Answer:
The code prints a message stating 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of the popped integer `num`. The variable `numbers` is not affected as the value is not changed. The variables `total`, `count`, and `num` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the popped integer.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the popped integer**
