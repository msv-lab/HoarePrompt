Output State: **numbers is an empty list, total contains the sum of all elements in the initial numbers list that are greater than 1, count holds the number of elements in the initial numbers list that are greater than 1, and num holds the last popped integer. If num is greater than 1, total is increased by num and count is incremented by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If the initial numbers list is empty, the values of total, count, and num remain unchanged.**
