Example Answer: 
The code prints a message 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value stored in `num`, which is the number popped from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, and `num` holds the value popped from the list. The print statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` list is updated based on the pop operation, `num` holds the value popped from the list**
