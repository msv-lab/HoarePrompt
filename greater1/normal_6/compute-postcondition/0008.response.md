Example Answer:
The last element of `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num` using the `pop()` method. Since `num` holds the last element removed, its value is the last element of the initial `numbers` list. The `total` and `count` variables are not affected by this operation, as they only consider elements greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in `numbers` that are greater than 1, and `num` is the last popped integer**
