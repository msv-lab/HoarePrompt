Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value stored in `num`. The variables `numbers`, `total`, `count`, and `num` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value if `num` > 1, 0 otherwise, `count` is 1 if `num` > 1, 0 otherwise, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value if `num` > 1, 0 otherwise, `count` is 1 if `num` > 1, 0 otherwise, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
