Output State: **If `numbers` list is not empty, the loop will continue. After each iteration, the last element of `numbers` is removed. If the removed number is greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding the removed number, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value. If the removed number is not greater than 1, 'Skipping non-positive number:' is printed followed by the value of the removed number. This process continues until `numbers` is empty. At the end of the loop, `total` contains the sum of all numbers removed that were greater than 1, `count` represents the count of such numbers, and `num` holds the last removed integer value. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total`, `count`, and `num` will remain 0.**
