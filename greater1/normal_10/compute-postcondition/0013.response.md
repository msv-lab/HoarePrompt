According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, it depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, the loop will continue. If `num` is not greater than 1, the loop will stop. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state of the program variables will depend on the values of `numbers`, `total`, `count`, and `num`. 

If there is a number greater than 1 in the `numbers` list, the loop will continue. `num` will be updated with the removed integer value, `total` will be updated with the sum of the previous total and `num`, and `count` will be increased by 1. 

If there is no number greater than 1 in the `numbers` list, the loop will stop and the function will print 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time:
- If there is a number greater than 1 in the `numbers` list, there should be at least one more number greater than 1 in the list.
- If there is no number greater than 1 in the `numbers` list, the list should not be empty.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers`, `total`, `count`, and `num` are adjusted according to the described conditions**
