Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, the loop will iterate until it is empty. `total` contains the sum of all numbers removed that were greater than 1, `count` represents the count of such numbers, and `num` holds the last removed integer value. If `numbers` is initially empty, `total`, `count`, and `num` will remain 0. `average` is calculated as `total / count`.**
