Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop` function. The list `numbers` will have one less element after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total`, `count`, and `num` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total`, `count`, and `num` are adjusted accordingly**
