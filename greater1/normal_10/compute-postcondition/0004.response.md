Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value, `count` is 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value, `count` is 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
