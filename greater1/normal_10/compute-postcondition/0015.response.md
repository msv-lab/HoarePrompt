Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The previous values of `total` and `num` are unknown, so the new total will depend on the actual values of `total` and `num` before the addition. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` is updated by adding `num`, `count` and `num` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is updated by adding `num`, `count` and `num` are adjusted accordingly**
