Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed integer value, `count` is 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value. In the latter case, the program also prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value stored in `num`.***
