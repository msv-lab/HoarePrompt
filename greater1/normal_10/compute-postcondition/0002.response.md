Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The previous values of the variables are `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0. After execution, `num` holds the removed integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
