Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to align with the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list of integers `numbers`, iterates through the list to remove numbers, and calculates the average of the positive integers in the list. It updates the `total`, `count`, and `num` variables accordingly. If a positive integer greater than 1 is encountered, it adds it to the total and increments the count. If the list is initially empty, the function correctly returns None. If the list contains only non-positive numbers, the function also correctly returns None. The code seems to handle the case of finding the average of positive integers in a list as described in the problem statement.
