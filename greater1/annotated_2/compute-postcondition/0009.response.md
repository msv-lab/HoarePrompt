Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, and `num` is not defined in the initial state. Since `num` is not defined, we cannot calculate the exact value of `total`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 1**
