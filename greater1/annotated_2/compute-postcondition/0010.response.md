Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 2**
