Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The `num` variable represents the integer popped from the `numbers` list. The `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers, `count` is 0, `num` is the integer popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers, `count` is 0, `num` is the integer popped from the list**
