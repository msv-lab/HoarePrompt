Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all popped integers, `count` is 1, and `num` is the integer popped from the list. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.***
