Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, the loop will execute until all elements are popped. If the popped `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all such numbers, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If the popped `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` will not change, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and a message will be printed for each non-positive `num`. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will be the sum of all popped integers, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If `numbers` is empty from the start, the loop will not execute and `total` and `count` will remain 0.**
