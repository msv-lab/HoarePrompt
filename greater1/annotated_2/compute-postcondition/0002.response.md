Example Answer:
The value `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. Since the list `numbers` is a list of integers, the value assigned to `num` will be an integer. The `pop()` method removes and returns the last item from the list. The values of `total` and `count` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the integer popped from the list**
