Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, after the loop execution, `numbers` will be an empty list. If the popped `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all popped integers, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and a message will be printed for each non-positive `num`. If the popped `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` will not change, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. After the loop finishes, if `count` is not 0, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of all popped integers divided by the count of elements greater than 1. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. If `numbers` is empty from the start, the loop will not execute, `total` and `count` will remain 0, and `average` will be 0 as well. Finally, the function will return the calculated `average`.**
