Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 2 if num > 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` remains a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 2 if num > 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` remains a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all popped integers and the value of `num`, `count` is 1**
