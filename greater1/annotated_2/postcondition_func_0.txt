The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and iterates through the list, updating `total` as the sum of all integers greater than 1, and `count` as the number of elements greater than 1. If a non-positive integer is encountered, a message is printed. After the loop finishes, if `count` is not zero, the function calculates the average of all integers greater than 1 and returns it. If `count` is zero, the function returns None. If the input list `numbers` is empty, the function returns None as well.
