Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with elements remaining. If the last element `num` is greater than 1, then `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If the last element `num` is less than or equal to 1, then there is no change to `total` or `count`, but a message is printed indicating the skipping of a non-positive number.***
