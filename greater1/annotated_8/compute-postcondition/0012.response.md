Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers. If the last element `num` is greater than 1, then `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is not greater than 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num' but still increases `total` by the value of `num` and `count` by 1.***
