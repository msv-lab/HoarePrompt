The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1: If the list `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, the function will iterate through the list, removing the last element in each iteration. If the removed element is greater than 1, the function will increase the `total` by the value of the removed element and increment the `count` by 1. If the removed element is not positive, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. The loop will continue until all positive integers in the list are processed. Once all positive integers have been processed, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will contain the sum of all positive integers in the initial list, and `count` will represent the count of positive integers processed. If `numbers` initially contains no positive integers, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. In the else part, if the count is not 0, the average will be calculated as total divided by count.

Case 2: The functionality is the same as in Case 1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers as input, process the positive integers in the list as described above, and calculate the total sum and count of positive integers. If positive integers are present, the function will also calculate and return the average of the positive integers.
