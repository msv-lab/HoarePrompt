Output State: **If the list `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration, the last element of `numbers` will be removed. If the removed element `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be increased by the value of `num` and `count` will be incremented by 1. If `num` is not positive, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. The loop will continue until all positive integers in the list are processed. Once all positive integers have been processed, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will contain the sum of all positive integers in the initial list, and `count` will represent the count of positive integers processed. If `numbers` initially contains no positive integers, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. In the else part, if the count is not 0, the average will be calculated as total divided by count.**
