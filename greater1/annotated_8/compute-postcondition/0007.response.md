According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the `numbers` list has the last element removed, and the last element `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not positive, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list should not be empty after the removal of the last element, and the last element `num` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed (not empty), `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and the last element `num` is greater than 1**
