According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the last element `num` is greater than 1, then `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must still have elements in it.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with elements remaining, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the last element of `num`**
