Example Answer: 
`num` is added to `total`. The value of `num` contains the last removed element, and `total` stores the sum of all removed elements. After the addition, the new value of `total` will be the sum of all previously removed elements along with the last removed element stored in `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers list has elements removed, `num` contains the last element that was removed, `total` is the sum of all removed elements including the last removed element.
Output State: **numbers list has elements removed, `num` contains the last element that was removed, `total` is the sum of all removed elements including the last removed element**
