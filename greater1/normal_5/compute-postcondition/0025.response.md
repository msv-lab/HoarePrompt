The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function processes the list 'numbers' as follows:

Case 1: If 'numbers' is not empty, the function iterates through the list and performs the following operations for each element: If the element is greater than 1, it adds the element to a running total and increments a count. If the element is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed indicating the element is skipped. After processing all elements, it calculates the average of the elements greater than 1 and returns the result. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the function returns None.

Case 2: The function logic for Case 2 is identical to Case 1. It iterates through the list, processes each element, calculates the average of elements greater than 1, and returns the result. If the list is empty, the function returns None.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, process each element according to the described rules, and return the average of all elements greater than 1. If 'numbers' is empty, the function returns None.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, a list of integers. It processes each element in the list, calculates the average of all elements greater than 1, and returns the result. If the list is empty, the function returns None.**
