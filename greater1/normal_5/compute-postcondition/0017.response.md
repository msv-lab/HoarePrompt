Example Answer: 
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num' where num is the non-positive number. The number list still has elements remaining, so no change is made to the list. The total and count variables may need adjustment based on the value of num, but those adjustments are not specified in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num.
Output State: **numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num**
