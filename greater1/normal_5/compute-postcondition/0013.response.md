According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, elements have been removed from the `numbers` list and `num` contains the last element that was removed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list should still have elements remaining, so it needs to be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if `num` is greater than 1, `total` should be increased by `num` and `count` should be increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' should be printed to the console.

State: *numbers list still has elements remaining, total and count may need to be adjusted based on the value of num*
