Output State: **If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to execute until 'numbers' becomes empty. For each iteration, the last element of 'numbers' is removed and stored in 'num'. If 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' is incremented by the value of 'num' and 'count' is incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating that a non-positive number is being skipped. Once the loop finishes, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' contains the sum of all 'num' greater than 1, 'count' contains the count of all 'num' greater than 1. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and 'total' and 'count' will remain 0.**
