The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to the variable `num`. The state of the list `numbers` changes as it loses one element. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers list has elements removed and `num` contains the last element that was removed.
Output State: **numbers list has elements removed, `num` contains the last element that was removed**
