Example Answer:
The value `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. The list `numbers` will have one less element after popping, and `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
