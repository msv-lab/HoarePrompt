Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of numbers. If the last element removed from `numbers` was greater than 1, then `total` is increased by that value and `count` is increased by 1. If the last element removed was not greater than 1, then a non-positive number was skipped. Overall, after the if else block executes, `total` is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed from `numbers`, `count` is the count of such numbers, and the list `numbers` has been modified accordingly.***
