The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is not an empty list, the function iterates through the list, removing and storing the last element in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed and no changes are made to `total` or `count`. This process continues until all elements in `numbers` have been processed. If `numbers` is initially an empty list, the loop does not execute, leaving `total` and `count` as 0. Finally, the function computes the `average` as `total / count`.

Case_2: If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is not an empty list, the function follows the same process as described in Case_1 to calculate the `average`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list to calculate the average of all numbers greater than 1, and handle cases where the list is empty or all numbers are less than or equal to 1.
