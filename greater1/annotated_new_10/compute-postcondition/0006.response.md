Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, a message is printed stating that a non-positive number was skipped, and the state of `total` remains unchanged at 0 while `count` remains at 0.***
