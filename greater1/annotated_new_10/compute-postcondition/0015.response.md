Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The previous value of `total` is unknown, but the value of `num` is given as the removed last element of the list. Therefore, the new total is the sum of the previous total and the removed last element.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with the last element removed; `num` is the removed last element, `total` is the sum of the previous total and the removed last element**
