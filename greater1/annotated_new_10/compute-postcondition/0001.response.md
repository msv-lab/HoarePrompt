Example Answer: 
The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of `numbers` (list of integers) and `total` (which is 0) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0**
