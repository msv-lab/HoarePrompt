According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If the last element removed was greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of that element and `count` is increased by 1. If the last element removed was not greater than 1, then a non-positive number was skipped and the state of `total` remains unchanged at 0 while `count` remains at 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the list `numbers` is not empty after removing the last element.

State: **If the last element removed from `numbers` was greater than 1, then `total` should be increased by that value and `count` should be increased by 1. If the last element removed was not greater than 1, then a non-positive number was skipped.**
