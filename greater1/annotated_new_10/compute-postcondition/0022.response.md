Output State: **If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop will continue executing. After each iteration, the last element of `numbers` is removed and stored in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed and no changes are made to `total` or `count`. The loop will continue until all elements in `numbers` have been processed. If `numbers` is initially an empty list, the loop will not execute and the values of `total` and `count` will remain 0. `average` is calculated as `total / count`**
