The function func_1 accepts a list of integers called numbers. It iterates through the list, calculating the total sum of all numbers greater than 1 and the count of such numbers. If the count is 0, the function returns None. If there are numbers greater than 1 in the list, it computes the average of those numbers and returns it. If the list is empty, the function returns None. In case where the list only contains numbers less than or equal to 1, no changes are made to the total or count.
