Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the condition `if num > 1:` which only includes numbers greater than 1 in the calculation of the average. However, the problem description asks for the average of all positive integers, which includes 1.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`. The program will skip the number 1 and calculate the average of only 2 and 3, which is incorrect. The correct average should include all positive integers, including 1.
