Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the condition `if num > 1` should be `if num > 0` in order to find the average of positive integers in the list. As per the problem description, we need to find the average of positive integers, not just numbers greater than 1.

Therefore, the code provided does not handle the case where the list contains positive integers less than or equal to 1. This means that the code will skip these numbers and not include them in the calculation of the average, which is incorrect.

The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the code, but the logic inside the loop is not in line with the problem description. The annotations mention the condition `if num is greater than 1`, which is the root cause of the incorrect behavior.

Overall, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, so the correctness is **False**.
