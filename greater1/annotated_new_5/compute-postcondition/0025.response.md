The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the function will iterate through the list, incrementing 'total' by the sum of all numbers greater than 1 and 'count' by the number of elements greater than 1. If a number less than or equal to 1 is encountered, a message will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be empty, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1, and 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1. If 'count' is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function calculates the 'average' as the division of 'total' by 'count'.

Case 2: The function behavior is the same as in Case 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers 'numbers', iterate through the list, calculate the sum of all numbers greater than 1, count the number of elements greater than 1, print a message for non-positive numbers, and return the average of the numbers greater than 1 if there are any. If 'numbers' is initially empty, the function returns None.
