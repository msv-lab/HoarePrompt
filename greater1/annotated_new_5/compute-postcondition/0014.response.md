Example Answer: 
`num` is assigned the value popped from `numbers`, reducing the size of the list by 1. The value of `num` is now removed from the list. The states of `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with reduced size, `num` is the popped integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with reduced size, `num` is the popped integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly**
