Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `count` is 1**
