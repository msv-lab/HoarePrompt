According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. The decision to continue the loop depends on the next element in the list. If the next element `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints a message and `total` remains 0, and `count` remains 0.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the next element in the list is greater than 1, do nothing as the loop can continue.
- If the next element in the list is less than or equal to 1, the message will be printed, and `total` will remain 0, and `count` will remain 0.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If the next number in the list is less than or equal to 1, `total` is 0, `count` is 0.**
