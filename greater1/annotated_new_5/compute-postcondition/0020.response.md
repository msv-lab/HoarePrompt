Output State: **If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the loop will continue to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each popped element 'num', if 'num' is greater than 1, 'total' will be incremented by 'num' and 'count' will be incremented by 1. If 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' will be an empty list, 'total' will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, 'count' will be the number of elements greater than 1 in the initial list. If 'numbers' is initially an empty list, 'total' and 'count' will both be 0.**
