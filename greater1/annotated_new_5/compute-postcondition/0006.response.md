Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If the number `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all numbers in the list `numbers`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and in this case, `total` remains 0, and `count` remains 0.***
