Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The problem description asks to find the average of the positive integers in a list, but the program only considers integers greater than 1 as positive. This means that the program will skip the number 1, which is indeed a positive integer.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will skip the number 1 and calculate the average of the remaining numbers, which is (2 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 3. However, the correct average of the positive integers in the list should be (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input list contains the number 1.
