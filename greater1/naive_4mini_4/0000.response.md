Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the list contains positive integers that are equal to 1. According to the problem description, the average should be calculated based on all positive integers, including 1. However, the program currently skips any number that is less than or equal to 1, which means it would ignore the integer 1 when calculating the average. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the expected average of the positive integers (which should include 1) would be `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. However, the program would skip 1 and only consider 2 and 3, leading to an incorrect result of `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. 

This shows that the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for all potential cases.
