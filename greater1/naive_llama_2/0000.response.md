Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program skips non-positive numbers and prints a message, but it does not handle the case where the input list contains only non-positive numbers and the number 1, which is also not considered a positive number in this context.

For example, if the input list is `[0, -1, 1]`, the program will skip all numbers and return `None`, but it should return `None` without printing any messages because there are no positive integers in the list. However, the program will print 'Skipping non-positive number: 0', 'Skipping non-positive number: -1', and 'Skipping non-positive number: 1'. 

Additionally, the program modifies the input list by popping elements from it, which may not be the intended behavior. 

A correct implementation should not modify the input list and should handle the case where the input list contains only non-positive numbers correctly.
