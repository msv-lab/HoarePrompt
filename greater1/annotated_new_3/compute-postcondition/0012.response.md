Postcondition: ***numbers is a list of integers with either the same number of elements or one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the updated list where each element is greater than 1, count is the number of elements in the updated list that are greater than 1 plus 1, and `num` is either the integer that was removed from the list or the non-positive number that was skipped. If num > 1, total is increased by num and count is incremented by 1. If num is not greater than 1, the list numbers has one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the updated list where each element is greater than 1, count is the number of elements in the updated list that are greater than 1, and num is the non-positive number that was skipped.***
