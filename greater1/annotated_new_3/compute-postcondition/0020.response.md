Output State: **If numbers is not empty, total is the sum of all elements in the list where each element is greater than 1, count is the number of elements in the list that are greater than 1, and num is the last integer removed from the list. If num > 1, total is increased by num and count is incremented by 1. If num is not greater than 1, the loop will remove elements until it encounters a non-positive number, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and continue. After the loop finishes, numbers is an empty list, total contains the sum of all elements greater than 1, count is the number of elements greater than 1, and num is the last integer removed from the list. If numbers is initially empty, total and count remain 0, and the loop does not execute.**
