Output State: **If the list 'numbers' is not empty, 'total' is the sum of all elements greater than 1, 'count' is the number of elements greater than 1, and 'num' is the last integer removed from the list. If 'num' > 1, 'total' is increased by 'num' and 'count' is incremented by 1. If 'num' is not greater than 1, elements are removed until a non-positive number is encountered, with the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' printed. After the loop finishes, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' contains the sum of all elements greater than 1, 'count' is the number of elements greater than 1, and 'num' is the last integer removed from the list. If 'numbers' is initially empty, 'total' and 'count' remain 0, and the loop does not execute. If 'count' is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if 'numbers' is not empty, 'average' is the total sum of all elements greater than 1 divided by the count of such elements, and 'num' is the last integer removed from the list. If 'numbers' is initially empty, 'average' remains 0 and the loop does not execute. The function returns the calculated 'average'.**
