Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to `total`, and `total` keeps track of the sum of all elements in the list. Since `num` was removed from the list, it does not affect the state of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the list and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the list, count is 0, and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list**
