According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of all elements in the list where each element is greater than 1, `count` is the number of elements in the list that are greater than 1 plus 1, and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must not be empty. Additionally, if the removed `num` is greater than 1, `total` should be adjusted by incrementing it by `num` and `count` should be incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed, and `total` remains the same while `count` remains the same as the initial value.

State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is the sum of all elements in the list where each element is greater than 1, count is the number of elements in the list that are greater than 1 plus 1, and `num` is the integer that was removed from the list.**
