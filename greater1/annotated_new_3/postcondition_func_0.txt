The function func_1 accepts a list of integers 'numbers'. It iterates over the list, calculates the sum of elements greater than 1, counts the number of such elements, and then computes the average of those elements. If the list is empty or contains no elements greater than 1, the function returns None. If 'numbers' contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will continue removing elements until it encounters a non-positive number, and the function will print a message for each skipped non-positive number. The function returns the calculated average of elements greater than 1.
