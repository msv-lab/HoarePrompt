Example Answer:
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, and `num` is the last element removed from the list of `numbers`. The previous states are: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of the last element removed from the list and the previous total, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of the last element removed from the list and the previous total, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element removed from the list**
