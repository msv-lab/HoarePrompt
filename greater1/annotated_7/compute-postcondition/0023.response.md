Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `numbers` will be an empty list. If there are elements greater than 1 in the original list, `total` will be the sum of those elements, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If there are no elements greater than 1, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are non-positive numbers in the list, a message will be printed for each, but `total` and `count` will not be changed. If count is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as `total / count`.***
