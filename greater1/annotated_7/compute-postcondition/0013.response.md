According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers` being non-empty. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must still have at least 1 element at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated by adding `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the last element is removed from the list. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` is updated based on the removal of the last element, `count` is also updated based on the removal of the last element, and the last element is removed from the list. If `num` is non-positive, a message is printed but no changes are made to `total`, `count`, or `numbers`.**
