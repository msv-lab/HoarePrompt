According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must still have elements in it. Since the list `numbers` has one less element after each iteration, the list must have had at least 2 elements at the end of the previous iteration for it to have one element remaining for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `total` is the sum of the last element removed from the list and the previous total if the last element is greater than 1, `count` is 1 if the last element is greater than 1, and `num` is the last element removed from the list.**
