Example Answer: 
The variable `num` is assigned the value of the last element in the list `numbers` after removing it from the list. Since the list `numbers` has at least one element left, the value of `num` will be the last element of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list**
