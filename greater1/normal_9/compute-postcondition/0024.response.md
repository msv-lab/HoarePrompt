Output State: **If the list `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are elements in the list, `total` will hold the sum of all numbers greater than 1, `count` will represent the count of such numbers, and `numbers` will be empty. After the loop finishes, if `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as `total / count`.**
