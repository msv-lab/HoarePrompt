According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` has at least one element left. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: if `num` is greater than 1, `total` has been incremented by `num` and `count` has been increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, and `num` holds the last removed non-positive number.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `num` is greater than 1, then `total` needs to be incremented by `num` and `count` needs to be increased by 1.
2. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, then `numbers` should still have at least one element left, and `num` should hold the last removed non-positive number.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` has been incremented by `num`, and `count` has been increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, and `num` holds the last removed non-positive number.**
