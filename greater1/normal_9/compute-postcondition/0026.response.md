Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a list of integers 'numbers' and calculates the average of numbers greater than 1 in the list. If there are no numbers greater than 1 in the list, it returns None. The function iterates over the list, summing the numbers greater than 1 and counting them. After the loop finishes, if there are no numbers greater than 1, it returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the average and returns it.**
