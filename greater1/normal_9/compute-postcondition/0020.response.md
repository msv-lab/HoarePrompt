Output State: **If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute. In this case, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If there are elements in the list, the loop will iterate through each element. For each iteration, if the popped `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be updated by adding `num` and `count` will be incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed and `total` and `count` will remain unchanged. After the loop finishes, `total` will hold the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the list, `count` will represent the count of such numbers, and `numbers` will be empty.**
