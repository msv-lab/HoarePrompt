Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The `numbers` list still has elements left. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list, `total` has been incremented by `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list, `total` has been incremented by `num`**
