Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The description states that the program should find the average of positive integers in a list, but the code only considers numbers greater than 1. The problem description does not specify that the numbers need to be greater than 1, so this is a deviation from the requirements. Additionally, the code prints a message when encountering non-positive numbers, which is not mentioned in the problem description. This discrepancy indicates that the code is incorrect.
