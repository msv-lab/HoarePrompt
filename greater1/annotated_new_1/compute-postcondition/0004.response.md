Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers list has one less element, total is increased by the value of the removed element, `count` is 1, `num` has the value of the removed element.
Output State: **numbers list has one less element, total is increased by the value of the removed element, `count` is 1, `num` has the value of the removed element**
