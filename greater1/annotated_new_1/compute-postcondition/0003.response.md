Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`. The value of `num` is the removed element from the original list, and the `total` is increased by this value. The other variables `numbers list`, `total`, and `count` are not affected. 
Output State: **numbers list has one less element (depending on the original list), total is increased by the value of the removed element, count is 0, `num` has the value of the removed element**
