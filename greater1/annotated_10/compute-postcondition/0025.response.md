The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function has two cases based on different conditions:

Case 1: If the count of numbers in the list is 0, the function returns None. If the list is not empty, the function will iterate through the list and pop out all numbers greater than 1. After the loop finishes, `total` will be the sum of all popped numbers, `count` will be the count of such numbers, and the list `numbers` will be empty. If the list is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total`, `count`, and `numbers` will all be 0. If the list is not empty, `average` will be the average of all popped numbers greater than 1.

Case 2: If the list `numbers` is not empty, after the loop finishes executing, `average` will be the average of all numbers greater than 1 that were popped from the list. If the list is initially empty, `average`, `total`, and `count` will all be 0, and the list `numbers` will be empty.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list, calculate the total, count, and average of numbers greater than 1, and update the list accordingly. If the list is initially empty, the function will return 0 for average, total, and count. If the count of numbers in the list is 0, the function will return None.
