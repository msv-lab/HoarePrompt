Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The other variables `total` is updated according to the sum of the previous total and `num`, and `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated according to the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element.
Output State: **`total` is updated according to the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is incremented by 1, and `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element**
