Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to `total`, where `num` is the last element of the `numbers` list. The `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated with the addition of `num`, `count` remains the same, `numbers` still has one less element, and `num` is the last element of the original list.
Output State: **`total` is updated with the addition of `num`, `count` remains the same, `numbers` still has one less element, and `num` is the last element of the original list**
