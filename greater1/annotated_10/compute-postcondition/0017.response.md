Example Answer:
The print statement skips non-positive numbers and prints the value of `num`, which is the last element of the original list. The variables `total`, `count`, and `numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total`, `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `num` is assigned the last element of the original list.
Output State: **`total`, `count` are integers, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, `num` is assigned the last element of the original list**
