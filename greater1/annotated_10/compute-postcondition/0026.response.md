Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, calculates the total sum and count of numbers greater than 1 that are popped from the list. If the count of such numbers is 0, the function returns None. If the list is not empty, it computes the average of the numbers greater than 1 and returns it. If the list is initially empty, the function returns 0 for average, total, and count.**
