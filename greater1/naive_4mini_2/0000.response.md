Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the average of positive integers in a list, but it has several issues:

1. The condition `if num > 1:` only counts integers greater than 1 as positive. This means that the number 1 is not included in the average calculation, which contradicts the problem description that asks for the average of positive integers (which should include 1).

2. The use of `numbers.pop()` modifies the original list, removing elements from it. This can lead to unintended side effects if the original list is needed after the function call.

3. The program prints a message for non-positive numbers. While this is not inherently wrong, it is not specified in the problem description and could be considered extraneous output.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the correct average of the positive integers should be `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. However, due to the current implementation, the average returned would be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
