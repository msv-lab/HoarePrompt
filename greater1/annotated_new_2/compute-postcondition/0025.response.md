The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is not empty, the function calculates the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the list and the number of elements greater than 1. If any element in `numbers` is non-positive, a message stating 'Skipping non-positive number' is printed. If `numbers` is empty, the function sets `total` and `count` to 0. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the `average` as the total divided by count.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers` and calculate the sum of all numbers greater than 1, the count of such numbers, and the average of those numbers. It also handles cases where the list is empty, contains non-positive numbers, or has no numbers greater than 1.
