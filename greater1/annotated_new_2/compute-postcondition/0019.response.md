According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If `numbers` still has elements, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` has one less element, and `num` holds the removed element. If `num` is greater than 1, the total is increased by `num` and the count is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, a message is printed stating that a non-positive number is being skipped. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Ensure that `numbers` still has elements (i.e., `numbers` is not empty).
2. Adjust `numbers` has one less element to reflect the current state.
3. Update `num` to hold the next removed element.
4. Check if `num` is greater than 1 to determine if the total and count need to be updated.

State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the next removed element.**
