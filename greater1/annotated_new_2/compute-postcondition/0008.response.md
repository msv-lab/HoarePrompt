Example Answer:
The last element of `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The values of `total` and `count` may change based on the value of `num`. If `num` was, for example, 5, then `total` and `count` could be updated accordingly. Since the exact values are unknown, the output state will be based on the possible values of `total` and `count`.
Output State: **`numbers` has at least one element left, `total` and `count` may or may not be updated based on the last element `num`**
