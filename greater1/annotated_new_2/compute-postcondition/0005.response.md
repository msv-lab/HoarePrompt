Example Answer:
The code prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped, using the value of `num` which is the last element of the list. The variables `numbers`, `total`, and `count` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element of the list.
Output State: **`numbers` has the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element of the list**
