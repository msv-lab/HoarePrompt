Example Answer: 
The code prints the message 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. This indicates that the element removed from the list is a non-positive number. The state of the variables `numbers` and `num` remains the same as they were before the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the removed element.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` holds the removed element**
