Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is not empty, `total` is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the list, `count` is the number of elements greater than 1 in the list. If `numbers` is empty, `total` is 0, `count` is 0. If any element in `numbers` is non-positive, a message stating 'Skipping non-positive number' is printed. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as the total divided by count.***
