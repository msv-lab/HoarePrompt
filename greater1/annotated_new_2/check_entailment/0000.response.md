Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and calculates the average of the positive integers in the list. It correctly iterates through the list, calculates the sum of positive integers greater than 1, counts the number of such integers, and computes the average. It handles cases where the list is empty, where there are non-positive numbers in the list, and where there are no positive integers greater than 1 in the list. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the program flow and the handling of different scenarios, and upon reviewing the code and annotations, it is evident that the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
