The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates over the list, summing up the numbers greater than 1 and counting them. If no numbers greater than 1 are found, it returns None. If the input list contains only non-positive integers or is empty, the function also returns None. After processing, it calculates and returns the average of the numbers greater than 1.
