Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function should find the average of the positive integers in the list, but it only checks for numbers greater than 1. This means it will skip over positive integers that are equal to 1. The description states that it should find the average of positive integers, not just those greater than 1. 

Additionally, the code does not handle the case of an empty list correctly. The description specifies that if the list is empty, the function should return None. However, the code does not check for an empty list and will throw an error when trying to pop from an empty list. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the discrepancies between the code and the problem description.
