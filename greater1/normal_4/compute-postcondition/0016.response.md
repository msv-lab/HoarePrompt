Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` if it is greater than 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed; `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` if it is greater than 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed; `count` is increased by 1**
