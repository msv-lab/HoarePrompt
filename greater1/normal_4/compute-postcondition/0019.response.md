According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows: *If the last removed `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If the last removed `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In both cases, `total` and `count` are updated according to the condition met by `num`.

State: **`total` and `count` are updated according to the condition met by the last removed `num`, and `numbers` is not empty**
