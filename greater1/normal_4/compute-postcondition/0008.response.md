Example Answer:
The last element of the `numbers` list is removed and assigned to `num`. The `total` is adjusted by subtracting the removed `num` value and `count` is decreased by 1 since an element has been removed from the list. 
Output State: **`numbers` list has one less element, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list**
