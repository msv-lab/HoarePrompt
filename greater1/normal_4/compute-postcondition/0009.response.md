Example Answer: 
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, which was the last element removed from the `numbers` list. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has one less element, `total` is adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list, `count` remains the same.
Output State: **`numbers` list has one less element, `total` is adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list, `count` remains the same**
