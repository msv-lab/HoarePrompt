Example Answer:
If the last removed `num` is greater than 1, then `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The states of `total` and `count` will change accordingly. If the last removed `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed but the state remains the same.
Output State: **`total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` if it is greater than 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.**
