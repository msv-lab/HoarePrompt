Output State: **If count is 0, the function returns None. If the initial numbers list contains only non-positive integers or is empty, the loop does not execute, and total and count remain 0. If the numbers list is not empty and all numbers in the list are greater than 1, the loop will execute. After the loop finishes, total will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1, count will be the number of elements greater than 1, and the numbers list will be empty. Subsequently, the average will be calculated as the division of total by count.**
