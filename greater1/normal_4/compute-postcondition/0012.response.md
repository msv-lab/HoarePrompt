Postcondition: ***`numbers` list has one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, then `total` is incremented by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In either case, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the last removed `num` from the list.***
