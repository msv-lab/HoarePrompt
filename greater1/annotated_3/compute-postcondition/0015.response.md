Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, which means that `total` is increased by the value of `num`. The length of the `numbers` list remains the same or decreases by one, adjusting the variables accordingly. 
Output State: **`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is adjusted accordingly**
