Postcondition: ***`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list, `count` is the number of positive numbers in the original list, and `num` has the value popped from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, it is added to `total` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, it is skipped and not included in the sum.***
