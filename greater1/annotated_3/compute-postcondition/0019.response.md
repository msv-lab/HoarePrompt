According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. The conditions for adjusting the states are based on the value of `num` from the `numbers` list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. In all cases, `count` is adjusted accordingly.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list should have at least one element remaining. If the last `num` processed was greater than 1, then `total` would have been increased by that value and `count` would have been increased by 1. If the last `num` processed was not greater than 1, then `total` and `count` would remain unchanged, but the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' would have been printed.

State: **`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of the last `num` processed in the previous iteration.**
