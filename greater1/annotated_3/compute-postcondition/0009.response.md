Example Answer:
The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The value of `num` is popped from the `numbers` list, and the original list had either one less element or the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list plus the popped number `num`, `count` is the number of positive numbers in the original list, and `num` has been popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total` is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list plus the popped number `num`, `count` is the number of positive numbers in the original list, and `num` has been popped from the list**
