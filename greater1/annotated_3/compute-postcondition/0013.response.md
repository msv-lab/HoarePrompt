According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the `numbers` list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list plus the popped number `num`, `count` is the number of positive numbers in the original list plus 1, and `num` has been popped from the list. If `num` is not greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all positive numbers in the original list, `count` is the number of positive numbers in the original list, and `num` has been popped from the list. The function prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num` if `num` is not greater than 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` list has either one less element or remains the same, `total`, `count`, and `num` adjusted according to the conditions mentioned above.**
