Example Answer:
The code prints the message 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. The `num` variable was popped from the `numbers` list, so it was a non-positive number. The variables `total`, `count`, and the `numbers` list are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` list has one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` has been printed as a skipped non-positive number.
Output State: **`numbers` list has one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` has been printed as a skipped non-positive number**
