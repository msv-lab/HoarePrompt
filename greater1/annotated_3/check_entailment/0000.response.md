Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program calculates the average of positive integers in a given list correctly. It iterates through the list and adds up the positive integers while keeping track of the count of positive integers. If there are no positive integers in the list, it returns None as expected. The annotations also accurately describe the behavior of the program, indicating that it handles cases where the list is empty or contains only non-positive integers. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
