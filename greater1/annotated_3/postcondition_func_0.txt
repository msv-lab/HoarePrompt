The function func_1 accepts a list of integers numbers and calculates the average of positive numbers in the list. If there are no positive numbers, it returns None. The code iterates through the list, summing up positive integers greater than 1 and counting them. If the list is empty or contains no positive numbers greater than 1, it returns None.
