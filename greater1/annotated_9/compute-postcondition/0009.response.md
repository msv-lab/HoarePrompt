Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`, where `num` is the last element removed from the list. The total is incremented by the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list, and `total` is updated with the addition of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `num` is the last element that was removed from the list, `total` is updated with the addition of `num`**
