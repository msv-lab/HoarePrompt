Output State: **If `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute. After each iteration, `num` will hold the last element removed from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be updated by adding `num`, `count` will be incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed indicating that a non-positive number is skipped. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0.**
