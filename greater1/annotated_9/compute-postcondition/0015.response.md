Example Answer:
`total` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it. The previous values of `total` and `num` are unknown. The state of `numbers` does not change, and there may be a message printed during execution.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is updated, `count` may have been updated, and a message may have been printed**
