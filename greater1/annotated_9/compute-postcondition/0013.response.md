According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `numbers`. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has one less element, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list. 

To execute the loop one more time, the list `numbers` must still have elements remaining. There are two possibilities for the adjustment of states:
1. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is increased by 1.
2. If `num` is not greater than 1, no adjustment to `total` or `count` is required, but a message is printed indicating that a non-positive number is skipped.

State: **`numbers` has at least one element remaining in the list, and appropriate adjustments are made to `total`, `count`, and a message is printed if necessary.**
