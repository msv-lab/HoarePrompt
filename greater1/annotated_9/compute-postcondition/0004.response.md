Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` has been updated with the addition of `num`, `count` has been increased by 1, and `num` holds the value of the removed element.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` has been updated with the addition of `num`, `count` has been increased by 1, and `num` holds the value of the removed element**
