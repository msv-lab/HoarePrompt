Example Answer:
The value at the end of the `numbers` list is removed and assigned to `num`. The `total` and `count` variables may be updated based on the removed value. If `numbers` is now empty, a message may be printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated, and a message may have been printed.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated, and a message may have been printed**
