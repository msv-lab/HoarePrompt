Postcondition: ***`numbers` has one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` has been updated with the addition of `num`, `count` has been increased by 1, and `num` holds the value of the removed element. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the value of the removed element. In all cases, the state of the program is correctly maintained after the execution of the if else block.***
