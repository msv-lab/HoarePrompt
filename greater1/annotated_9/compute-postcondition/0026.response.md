Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, removing all numbers greater than 1. For each number greater than 1, it updates the `total` by adding that number and increments the `count` by 1. If a number less than or equal to 1 is encountered, a message is printed indicating a non-positive number is skipped. After the loop finishes, the list `numbers` will be empty, `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `count` is 0 after the loop, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the average as `total` divided by `count` and returns it.**
