Postcondition: ***`numbers` has one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not greater than 1, a message 'Skipping non-positive number:', followed by the value of `num` is printed. In either case, after the execution of the if else block, `numbers` has one less element, `total` may have been updated, `count` may have been updated, and a message may or may not have been printed based on the condition.***
