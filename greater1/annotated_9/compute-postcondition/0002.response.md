Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` depends on the last element of the original list `numbers`. The values of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the value of the removed element from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` has one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the value of the removed element from the list**
