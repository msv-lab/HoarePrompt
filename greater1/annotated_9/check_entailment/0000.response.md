Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly find the average of the positive integers in a list as per the problem description. The issue lies in the condition `if num > 1:` which should be `if num > 0:` to correctly handle positive integers. As a result, the code may skip positive integers that are equal to 1, leading to an incorrect average calculation.
