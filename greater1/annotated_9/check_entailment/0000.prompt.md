You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    total = 0
    #State of the program here: numbers is a list of integers, total is 0
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: numbers is a list of integers, total is 0, count is 0
    while numbers:
        num = numbers.pop()
        
        if num > 1:
            total += num
            count += 1
        else:
            print('Skipping non-positive number:', num)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute. After each iteration, `num` will hold the last element removed from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be updated by adding `num`, `count` will be incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed indicating that a non-positive number is skipped. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0.
    if (count == 0) :
        return None
        #State of the program after the return statement: `numbers` is empty, `total` is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` is the count of numbers greater than 1, and there are no non-positive numbers left in the list
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `numbers` is empty, `total` is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` is the count of numbers greater than 1, and there are no non-positive numbers left in the list
    else :
        average = total / count
        #State of the program here: `numbers` is empty, `total` contains the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` represents the count of numbers greater than 1, `average` is calculated as `total / count`
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: `numbers` is empty, `total` contains the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, `count` represents the count of numbers greater than 1, `average` is calculated as `total / count`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If numbers is not empty, the loop will remove all numbers greater than 1 from the list. If num > 1, total will be updated by adding num, count will be incremented by 1. If num <= 1, a message indicating a non-positive number is skipped will be displayed. After the loop finishes, numbers will be empty, total will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, count will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0. In all cases, after the if-else block executes, if count is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, average will be calculated as total divided by count.
    return average
    #State of the program after the return statement: If numbers is not empty, the loop removes all numbers greater than 1 from the list. If num > 1, total will be updated by adding num, count will be incremented by 1. If num <= 1, a message indicating a non-positive number is skipped will be displayed. After the loop finishes, numbers will be empty, total will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, count will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0. In all cases, after the if-else block executes, if count is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, average will be calculated as total divided by count.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 
#
#Case 1: If the list `numbers` is not empty, the function will iterate through the list and remove all numbers greater than 1. For each number greater than 1, the total will be updated by adding that number, and the count will be incremented by 1. If a number less than or equal to 1 is encountered, a message indicating a non-positive number is skipped will be displayed. After the loop finishes, the list `numbers` will be empty, the variable `total` will contain the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, the variable `count` will represent the count of numbers greater than 1, and there will be no non-positive numbers left in the list. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. In all cases, after the if-else block executes, if `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, the average will be calculated as `total` divided by `count`.
#
#Case 2: The second case is the same as Case 1, with the same functionality.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, remove numbers greater than 1, calculate the sum and count of those numbers, and return the average if count is greater than 0. If the list is empty or no numbers greater than 1 are present, the function will return None.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
