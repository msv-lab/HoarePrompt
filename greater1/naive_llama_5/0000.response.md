Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the average of the positive integers in a list. The problem description does not specify that the input list should be modified, but the program uses the `pop` method to remove elements from the list, which modifies the original list. Additionally, the program prints a message for non-positive numbers, which is not specified in the problem description.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In this case, the program will return `None`, but it would be more correct to raise a `ValueError` or return a specific value to indicate that the input list is empty.

Finally, the program checks if a number is positive by checking if it is greater than 1, but this is not correct. A number is positive if it is greater than 0, not 1. Therefore, the program will incorrectly skip numbers that are equal to 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will return `2.5`, which is incorrect because it skips the number 1. If the input list is `[]`, the program will return `None`, which is not specified in the problem description.
