Output State: **If numbers is non-empty, the loop will continue. For each iteration, num will be assigned the popped value from numbers. If num is greater than 1, total will increase by num and count will increase by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process will continue until numbers is empty. After the loop finishes, total will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were popped from the list, count will be the number of such elements, and numbers will be empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0.**
