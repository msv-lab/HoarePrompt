Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` function, which removes and returns the last element from the list. The values of `total` and `count` may be adjusted based on the new value of `num`. The state of `numbers` changes as the last element is removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` has fewer elements, `num` has a new value, `total` and `count` may be adjusted.
Output State: **`numbers` has fewer elements, `num` has a new value, `total` and `count` may be adjusted**
