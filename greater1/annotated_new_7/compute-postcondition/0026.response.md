Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, calculates the average of all numbers greater than 1 in the list, and returns the average. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. The code iterates over the list, sums the numbers greater than 1, counts them, and calculates the average. If the list is empty, the function returns None.**
