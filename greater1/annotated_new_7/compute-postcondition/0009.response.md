Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list, and `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The previous value of `total` and the elements in `numbers` are unknown, so the output state is: `numbers` is modified due to popping an element, `num` is assigned the popped value from the list, `total` is increased by `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is modified due to popping an element, `num` is assigned the popped value from the list, `total` is increased by `num`**
