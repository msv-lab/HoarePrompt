The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case_1: If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is non-empty, the loop continues where for each iteration, `num` is assigned the popped value from `numbers`. If `num` > 1, `total` increases by `num` and `count` increases by 1. If `num` <= 1, a message is printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process continues until `numbers` is empty. After the loop, `total` is the sum of all numbers > 1, `count` is the number of such elements, and `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0. `average` is assigned the value `total / count`.

Case_2: If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is non-empty, the loop continues where for each iteration, `num` is assigned the popped value from `numbers`. If `num` > 1, `total` increases by `num` and `count` increases by 1. If `num` <= 1, a message is printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process continues until `numbers` is empty. After the loop, `total` is the sum of all numbers > 1, `count` is the number of such elements, and `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0. `average` is assigned the value `total / count` and the function returns the `average`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, calculate the average of all numbers greater than 1 in the list, and return the average. If `count` is 0, the function returns None.
