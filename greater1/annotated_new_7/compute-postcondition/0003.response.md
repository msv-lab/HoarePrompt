Example Answer: 
The value of `total` is increased by the value of `num`, but the previous value of `total` is 0 and the value of `num` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is 0**
