Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is modified due to popping an element, `num` is assigned the popped value from the list, `total` is increased by `num`, `count` is incremented by an unknown value.
Output State: **`numbers` is modified due to popping an element, `num` is assigned the popped value from the list, `total` is increased by `num`, `count` is incremented by an unknown value**
