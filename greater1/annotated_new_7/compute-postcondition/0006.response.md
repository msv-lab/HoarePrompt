Postcondition: ***`total`, `count` are integers. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` is 0 and `count` is 0. In both cases, if `num` is not positive, a message is printed stating that the non-positive number is skipped.***
