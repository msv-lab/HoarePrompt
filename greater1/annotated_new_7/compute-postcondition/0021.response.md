Output State: **If numbers is non-empty, the loop continues. For each iteration, num is assigned the popped value from numbers. If num > 1, total increases by num and count increases by 1. If num <= 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This continues until numbers is empty. After the loop, total is the sum of all numbers > 1, count is the number of such elements, and numbers is empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and total and count remain 0.**
