Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The state of the variable `total` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is 1**
