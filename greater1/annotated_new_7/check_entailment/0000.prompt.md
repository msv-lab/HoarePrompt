You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    total = 0
    #State of the program here: `total` is 0
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `total` is 0, `count` is 0
    while numbers:
        num = numbers.pop()
        
        if num > 1:
            total += num
            count += 1
        else:
            print('Skipping non-positive number:', num)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If numbers is non-empty, the loop will continue. For each iteration, num will be assigned the popped value from numbers. If num is greater than 1, total will increase by num and count will increase by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process will continue until numbers is empty. After the loop finishes, total will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were popped from the list, count will be the number of such elements, and numbers will be empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0.
    if (count == 0) :
        return None
        #State of the program after the return statement: If numbers is non-empty, the loop continues. For each iteration, num is assigned the popped value from numbers. If num > 1, total increases by num and count increases by 1. If num <= 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This continues until numbers is empty. After the loop, total is the sum of all numbers > 1, count is the number of such elements, and numbers is empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and total and count remain 0.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: If numbers is non-empty, the loop continues. For each iteration, num is assigned the popped value from numbers. If num > 1, total increases by num and count increases by 1. If num <= 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This continues until numbers is empty. After the loop, total is the sum of all numbers > 1, count is the number of such elements, and numbers is empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and total and count remain 0.
    else :
        average = total / count
        #State of the program here: If numbers is non-empty, the loop will continue. For each iteration, num will be assigned the popped value from numbers. If num is greater than 1, total will increase by num and count will increase by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process will continue until numbers is empty. After the loop finishes, total will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were popped from the list, count will be the number of such elements, and numbers will be empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0. `average` is assigned the value of `total / count`.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: If numbers is non-empty, the loop will continue. For each iteration, num will be assigned the popped value from numbers. If num is greater than 1, total will increase by num and count will increase by 1. If num is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process will continue until numbers is empty. After the loop finishes, total will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were popped from the list, count will be the number of such elements, and numbers will be empty. If numbers is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and total and count will remain 0. `average` is assigned the value of `total / count`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is non-empty, the loop continues where for each iteration, `num` is assigned the popped value from `numbers`. If `num` > 1, `total` increases by `num` and `count` increases by 1. If `num` <= 1, a message is printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process continues until `numbers` is empty. After the loop, `total` is the sum of all numbers > 1, `count` is the number of such elements, and `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0. `average` is assigned the value `total / count`
    return average
    #State of the program after the return statement: If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is non-empty, the loop continues where for each iteration, `num` is assigned the popped value from `numbers`. If `num` > 1, `total` increases by `num` and `count` increases by 1. If `num` <= 1, a message is printed indicating the skipping of the non-positive number. This process continues until `numbers` is empty. After the loop, `total` is the sum of all numbers > 1, `count` is the number of such elements, and `numbers` is empty. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and `total` and `count` remain 0. `average` is assigned the value `total / count` and the function returns the `average`.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, calculates the average of all numbers greater than 1 in the list, and returns the average. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. The code iterates over the list, sums the numbers greater than 1, counts them, and calculates the average. If the list is empty, the function returns None.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
