Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description. The description states that the function should find the average of the positive integers in the list and return None if the list is empty. However, the code is only checking if the number is greater than 1 instead of checking if it is a positive integer. This means that it will ignore positive integers that are equal to 1, which is incorrect. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input list is empty as it will result in an error when trying to pop an element from an empty list. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet all the requirements of the problem description.
