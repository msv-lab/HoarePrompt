Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. The previous values of `total` and `num` are unknown, so the output state is: numbers have the last element removed, total is updated based on the conditions, count is updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **numbers have the last element removed, total is updated based on the conditions, count is updated based on the conditions**
