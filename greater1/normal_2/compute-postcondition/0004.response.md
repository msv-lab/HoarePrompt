Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers have the last element removed, `total` is the sum of all the removed elements, `count` is 1.
Output State: **numbers have the last element removed, `total` is the sum of all the removed elements, `count` is 1**
