The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

Case 1: If the list 'numbers' is not empty, the function iterates through the list, removing the last element each time. If the removed number is greater than 1, 'total' is incremented by that number and 'count' is increased by 1. If the removed number is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed about skipping a non-positive number. After iterating through all numbers, 'numbers' becomes empty, 'total' is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, and 'count' is the count of such numbers. If 'numbers' is initially empty, 'total' and 'count' remain 0. In the else part, 'numbers' is empty, 'total' is the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that were removed, 'count' is the count of such numbers, and 'average' is calculated as the total divided by count.

Case 2: If 'numbers' is not empty, the function follows the same process as in Case 1, and then returns the calculated average.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list to calculate the sum of numbers greater than 1 and the count of such numbers, and return the average of those numbers.
