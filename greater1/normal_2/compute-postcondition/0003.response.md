Example Answer: 
`total` is increased by the value of `num`, but the previous values of `total` and `count` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: numbers have the last element removed, `total` is the sum of all the removed elements, `count` is 0.
Output State: **numbers have the last element removed, `total` is the sum of all the removed elements, `count` is 0**
