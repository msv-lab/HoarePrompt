According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `numbers` to have one more element in the list. No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one more element, `total` is updated based on the sum of the removed value and the previous total, `count` is increased by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num`, `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.**
