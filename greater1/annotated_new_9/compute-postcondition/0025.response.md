The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function iterates over the list `numbers`, removing elements one by one. After each iteration, the function updates `total` based on the sum of the removed value (if greater than 1) and the previous total, increases `count` by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1, and assigns the removed value to `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and the final state will have `total` as 0, `count` as 0, and `num` as 0. In the else part, where `numbers` is empty, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is 0, and `average` is undefined.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers` and calculate the average of all positive numbers in the list, while handling non-positive numbers appropriately. The function returns the calculated `average`.
