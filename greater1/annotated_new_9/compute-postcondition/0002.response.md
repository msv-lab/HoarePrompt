Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` is the integer that was removed from the list. The states of `total` and `count` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the value removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the value removed from the list**
