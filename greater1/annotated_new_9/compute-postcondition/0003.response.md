Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. Since `num` is the value removed from the list, it is being added to `total`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of the removed value and previous total, `count` is 0, and `num` is the value removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is the sum of the removed value and previous total, `count` is 0, and `num` is the value removed from the list**
