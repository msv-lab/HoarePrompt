Postcondition: ***If the list `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute, removing elements from the list one by one. After each iteration: `numbers` will have one less element, `total` will be updated based on the sum of the removed value (if greater than 1) and the previous total, `count` will be increased by 1 if the removed value is greater than 1, `num` will be the value removed from the list. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be incremented by `num` and `count` will be increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message will be printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and the final state will have `total` as 0, `count` as 0, and `num` as 0. In the else part, where `numbers` is empty, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is 0, and `average` is undefined.***
