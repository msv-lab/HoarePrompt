Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description. The main issue lies in the condition `if num > 1:` which should be `if num > 0:` based on the problem description. The current condition excludes positive integers that are equal to 1, which should be included in the calculation of the average. 

Additionally, the code does not account for the case where all the numbers in the list are non-positive integers. In this scenario, the code will return `None`, while the problem description requires the function to return 0 in such cases.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
