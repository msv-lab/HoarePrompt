The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. If `numbers` is not empty, the function processes all elements in `numbers`, removes integers greater than 1, calculates the total sum of the removed integers in `total`, and the count of removed integers in `count`. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, `total` and `count` remain 0. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the removed integers and returns it. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, the average is undefined.
