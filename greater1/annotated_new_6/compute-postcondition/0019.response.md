According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `numbers` list has at least one element left. The loop body involves popping an integer value `num` from the `numbers` list and checking if `num` is greater than 1 to increase `total` and `count` or print a message if `num` is less than or equal to 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the `numbers` list should still have at least one element left. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the `numbers` list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the popped integer value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.**
