Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` will be the last integer in the list. The values of `total` and `count` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the removed integer value**.
