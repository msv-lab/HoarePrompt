The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 

In Case 1, if `numbers` is not empty, the function will process all elements in `numbers` and remove integers greater than 1. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will contain the sum of all integers greater than 1 that were removed from `numbers`, and `count` will represent the total count of integers greater than 1 that were removed. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `count` is 0, the function returns None. Otherwise, `average` is calculated as the total divided by count. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, `average` will be undefined.

In Case 2, the functionality is the same as Case 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, process the list to remove integers greater than 1, calculate the total and count of removed integers, and return the average of the removed integers if count is not 0. If there are no integers greater than 1 in the initial `numbers` list, the function returns None.
