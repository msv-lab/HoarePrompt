Example Answer: 
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`, which is the popped integer from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` has at least one element left, so `num` is a valid integer value. The output state is `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the popped integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, `num` is the popped integer value**
