Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the popped integer value from the list `numbers`. Since `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left, the popped integer value is removed from the list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left; `num` is the popped integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element left; `num` is the popped integer value**
