Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less; `num` is the popped integer value, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element less; `num` is the popped integer value, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1**
