Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The values of `numbers`, `total`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`, `count` is 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated by adding the value of `num`, `count` is 1, and `num` holds the removed integer value**
