Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to calculate the average of positive integers in a list. However, it incorrectly skips positive integers that are equal to 1, as the condition `if num > 1` only includes numbers greater than 1. This means that if the input list contains the number 1 or any positive integers less than 1 (like 0), they will not be counted in the average calculation, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the function would return `None` because it would skip the number 1, and the count would be 0. The correct average should be `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. 

Thus, since the program does not work correctly for all potential inputs, the correctness is false.
