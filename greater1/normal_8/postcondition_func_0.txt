Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `numbers` and iterates through the elements. It calculates the sum and average of elements greater than 1 in the list. If there are no elements greater than 1 or the list is empty, the function returns None. If there are elements greater than 1, it returns the average of those elements. It does not handle negative numbers or zeros in the list as mentioned in the annotations, potentially missing functionality.
