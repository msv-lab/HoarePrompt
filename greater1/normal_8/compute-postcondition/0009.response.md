Example Answer: 
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, and `num` holds the popped value. The previous values of `total` and `num` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` may have been updated based on the last popped `num`, `num` holds the popped value**
