Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated with the addition of `num`, `count` is increased by 1, and `num` holds the popped value. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and `num` holds the popped value. Moreover, if `num` is a non-positive number, a message is printed indicating the skipping of that value.***
