Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. The previous value of `total` is 0, and `num` holds the popped value. After execution, the `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the added value of `num`, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the popped value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the added value of `num`, `count` is 0, and `num` holds the popped value**
