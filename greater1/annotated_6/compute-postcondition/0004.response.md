Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The values of `numbers` and `total` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the sum of its previous value and the value of `num`, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the sum of its previous value and the value of `num`, `count` is 1**
