Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.***
