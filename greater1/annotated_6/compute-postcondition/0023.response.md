Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of positive numbers divided by the count of positive numbers.***
