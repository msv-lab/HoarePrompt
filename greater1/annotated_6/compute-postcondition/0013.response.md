According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element and `num` is the popped integer. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must still have at least one element left in it. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element; `num` is the popped integer. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.**
