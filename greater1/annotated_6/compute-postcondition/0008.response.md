Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` will hold the value popped from the list. The `numbers` list will have one less element after the pop operation.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less element); `num` is the popped integer**
