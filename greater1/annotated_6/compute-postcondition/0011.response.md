Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a message stating that it is skipping a non-positive number. The integer `num` is the popped integer from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` has one less element now as `num` has been removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element; `num` is the popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element; `num` is the popped integer**
