You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    total = 0
    #State of the program here: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `numbers` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0
    while numbers:
        num = numbers.pop()
        
        if num > 1:
            total += num
            count += 1
        else:
            print('Skipping non-positive number:', num)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list.
    if (count == 0) :
        return None
        #State of the program after the return statement: Output State: If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: Output State: If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list.
    else :
        average = total / count
        #State of the program here: If `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of positive numbers divided by the count of positive numbers.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: If `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of positive numbers divided by the count of positive numbers.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty. At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, if `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of positive numbers divided by the count of positive numbers.
    return average
    #State of the program after the return statement: If `numbers` is initially empty, the function will return None. If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0. If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the function will calculate the average of all positive numbers and return that value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. 
#
#Case 1:
#- If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0.
#- If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, print the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` will remain 0.
#- If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the loop will iterate through each element, summing up the positive numbers in `total`, counting them in `count`, and removing elements from `numbers` until it becomes empty.
#- At the end, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of all positive numbers in the initial list, and `count` will be the count of positive numbers in the initial list.
#- If `count` is 0, the function will return None.
#- Otherwise, if `numbers` is initially empty, `total` and `count` will remain 0.
#- If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0.
#- If `numbers` contains positive numbers, `average` will be calculated as the total sum of positive numbers divided by the count of positive numbers.
#
#Case 2:
#- If `numbers` is initially empty, the function will return None.
#- If `numbers` contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will remain 0.
#- If `numbers` contains positive numbers, the function will calculate the average of all positive numbers and return that value.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `numbers`, iterate through the list to calculate the total sum and count of positive numbers, and then return different outputs based on the conditions specified in Case 1 and Case 2.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
