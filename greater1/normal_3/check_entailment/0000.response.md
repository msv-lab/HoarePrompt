Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The problem description states that if the input list is empty, the function should return None. However, the code returns 0 when the list is empty. This is a deviation from the expected behavior. 

Output hints suggest that if the input list contains only non-positive numbers, the function should return 0 for both the total and the count. However, this logic is not implemented in the code. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the case of an empty list correctly and does not return 0 when the list contains only non-positive numbers.
