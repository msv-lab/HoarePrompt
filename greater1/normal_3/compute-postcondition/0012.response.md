Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less element after `pop()`). `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` as mentioned in the initial state statement. If `num` is positive and greater than 1, `total` is incremented by `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is not positive, a message is printed and `total` and `count` remain unchanged.***
