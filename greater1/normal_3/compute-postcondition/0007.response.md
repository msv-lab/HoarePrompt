According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `numbers`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` had one less element. To make the loop execute one more time, the list `numbers` needs to have at least one element.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element, `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num` as mentioned in the initial state statement. If `num` is not positive, a message is printed as described.**
