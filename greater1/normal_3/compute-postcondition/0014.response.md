Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `numbers` after it has been removed with `pop()`. The list `numbers` now has one less element. The `total` and `count` variables are updated based on the value of `num` as mentioned in the initial state statement. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num`**
