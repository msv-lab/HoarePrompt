Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` will be the popped element from the list `numbers`. The value of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the popped integer.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the popped integer**
