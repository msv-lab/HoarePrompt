Output State: **If the initial list contains only non-positive numbers, `total` and `count` will both be 0. If there are positive numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, `total` will be the sum of all such numbers, `count` will be the number of positive numbers greater than 1. If `count` is not 0, the average will be calculated as `total` divided by `count`.**
