According to the code, the loop can execute one more time as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `numbers` list should still have elements in it. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element**
