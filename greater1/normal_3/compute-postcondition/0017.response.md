Example Answer:
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. The variables `numbers`, `total`, and `count` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num`**
