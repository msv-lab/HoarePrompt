Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated with the added value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` is 0 and `count` is 0. Additionally, if `num` is not positive, a message is printed stating 'Skipping non-positive number:', followed by the value of `num`.***
