Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated based on the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated based on the value of `num`, `count` is incremented by 1**
