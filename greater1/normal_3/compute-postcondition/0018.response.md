Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is increased by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num', and `total` and `count` are updated based on the value of `num`.***
