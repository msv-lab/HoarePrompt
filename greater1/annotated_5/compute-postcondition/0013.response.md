According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` is [1], so it is not empty and the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is [1], `total` is either 5 with `count` being 2 or 1 with `count` being 1, `num` is 2 if `num` is greater than 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `numbers` remains [1], `total` is either 3 with `count` being 1 or 0 with `count` being 0, `num` is 2**
