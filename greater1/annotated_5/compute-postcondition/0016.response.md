Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is either 1 or 0. After execution, the new value of `count` will be either 2 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is empty, `total` is either 4 with `count` being 2 or 1 with `count` being 1, `num` is 1.
Output State: **`numbers` is empty, `total` is either 4 with `count` being 2 or 1 with `count` being 1, `num` is 1**
