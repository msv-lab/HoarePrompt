Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It iterates through the list, summing up numbers greater than 1 and counting them. If no numbers greater than 1 are found, it returns None. If there are such numbers, it calculates and returns the average of those numbers. If all numbers in the list are non-positive, the function does not execute the loop and returns None. **
