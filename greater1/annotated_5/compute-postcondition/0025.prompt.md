You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: numbers is a list of integers.**
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Output: Case_1: *If the list `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, the loop will execute and pop each element from the list. If the popped element is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all such elements, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If the popped element is less than or equal to 1, it will be skipped, and a message will be printed. If all elements in `numbers` are non-positive, the loop will not execute, and both `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty. If `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, if the loop executes and elements are popped based on the conditions, `total` will be the sum of elements greater than 1, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If all elements are non-positive, `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty. The `average` will be calculated as `total / count`.

Case_2: If the list `numbers` contains at least one positive integer, the loop will execute, pop each element from the list, and calculate the average. If all elements are non-positive, the loop will not execute, and both `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
