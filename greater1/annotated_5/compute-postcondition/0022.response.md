Output State: **If the loop executes and elements are popped based on the conditions, `total` will be the sum of elements greater than 1, and `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1. If all elements are non-positive, `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty. The `average` will be calculated as `total / count`.**
