Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains positive integers. Specifically, it skips the integer `1` (since it checks if `num > 1`), which is a positive integer. According to the problem description, the average should be calculated for all positive integers, including `1`.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the expected average of the positive integers is `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. However, the program would skip `1`, resulting in an average of `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
