The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The function processes the list by removing elements one by one until the list becomes empty. If the removed element is greater than 1, it calculates the sum of such elements as `total`, counts the number of such elements as `count`, and updates the value of `num` to the last removed element. If the removed element is not greater than 1, it skips that element and updates `total`, `count`, and `num` accordingly. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. After processing the list, if `count` is not equal to 0, the function calculates the average as `total / count` and returns this value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers`, processes the list to calculate the average of elements greater than 1, and returns the calculated average.**
