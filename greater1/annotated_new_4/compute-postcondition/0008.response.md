Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The state of `numbers` is adjusted accordingly, having at least one element remaining. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly**
