Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to the variable `num`. The value of `num` depends on the last element of the list `numbers`. The `total` and `count` variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` contains the value of the removed element.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` contains the value of the removed element**
