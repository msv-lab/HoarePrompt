Example Answer:
The program prints the message 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value of `num`. The `num` integer is removed from the `numbers` list. The `total` and `count` variables are not directly affected by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` holds the removed integer, `total` and `count` are adjusted accordingly**
