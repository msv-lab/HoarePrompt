According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the list `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining**
