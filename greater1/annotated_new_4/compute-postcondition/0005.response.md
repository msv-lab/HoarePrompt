Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value in the variable `num`. The value in `num` is the removed element from the list `numbers`. The state of `numbers` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` contains the value of the removed element, and the code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value in `num`.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` contains the value of the removed element, and the code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:' followed by the value in `num`**
