According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `numbers`. At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed and `num` is the removed integer value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated with the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still elements in the `numbers` list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` is the removed integer value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated with the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'**
