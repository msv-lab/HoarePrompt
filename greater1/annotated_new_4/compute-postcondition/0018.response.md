Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed, `num` is the removed integer value. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is updated with the value of `num` and `count` is increased by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program prints 'Skipping non-positive number: num'.***
