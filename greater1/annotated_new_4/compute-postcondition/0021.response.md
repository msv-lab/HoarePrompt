Output State: **If the list `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue removing elements from the list until it becomes empty. If the removed element `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all such elements, `count` will be the number of such elements, and `num` will contain the last removed element. If `num` is not greater than 1, the code will skip that element and `total`, `count`, and `num` will be updated accordingly. If the list `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. The function returns None.**
