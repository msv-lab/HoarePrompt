Example Answer:
The value at the end of the `numbers` list is removed and assigned to `num`. As `numbers` had at least one element initially, `num` now holds the removed integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value**
