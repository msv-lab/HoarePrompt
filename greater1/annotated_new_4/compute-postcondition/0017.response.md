Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a message indicating that a non-positive number has been skipped, with the value of `num` being the removed integer. The list `numbers` already had at least one element removed. Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed; `num` is the removed integer value**
