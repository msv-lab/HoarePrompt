Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with one element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of all the elements in the list, `count` is incremented by 1, and `num` is the popped integer. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, `num` is the popped integer, and the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.***
