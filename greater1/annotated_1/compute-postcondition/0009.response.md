Example Answer: 
`total` is incremented by the value of `num`, which is the last element popped from the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` now has one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element, `total` is incremented by the value of the last element popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element, `total` is incremented by the value of the last element popped from the list**
