Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the list `numbers`. Since `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, the value of `num` will be the last element of the list. The list `numbers` will have one less element after popping. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element; `num` is the last element popped from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element; `num` is the last element popped from the list**
