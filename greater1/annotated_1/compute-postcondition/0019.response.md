According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If the last element was removed due to `num` being greater than 1, then no adjustments are needed for `numbers`.
- If the last element was removed due to `num` not being greater than 1, then the list `numbers` should have one less element.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one less element**
