Example Answer:
The variable `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. The list `numbers` has one less element now, and `total` and `count` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is the popped integer**
