Output State: **If the initial `numbers` list is not empty, the loop will continue until all elements are processed. After the loop finishes, `total` will be the sum of all elements in the list that are greater than 1, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and `numbers` will be an empty list. If all elements in the initial `numbers` list are less than or equal to 1, `total` and `count` will remain 0, and the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed for each element. If the initial `numbers` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the if else block, if `count` is 0, the function will return None. Otherwise, `numbers` will be an empty list, `total` will be the sum of all elements in the list that are greater than 1, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and `average` will be the average of elements greater than 1. The function will return the calculated average.**
