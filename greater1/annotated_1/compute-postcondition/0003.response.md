Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is added to `total`. Since `num` is the popped integer from the list `numbers` and `total` is initially 0, the value of `total` will be the same as `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one element removed, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 0, `num` is the popped integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one element removed, `total` is the value of `num`, `count` is 0, `num` is the popped integer**
