Example Answer:
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. Since the list `numbers` has at least one element, `num` will hold the value of the popped element. The length of the list `numbers` will decrease by one. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed, `num` is the popped integer**
