Output State: **If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `total` and `count` remain 0 and `num` is undefined.
If `numbers` contains only non-positive integers, the loop will not update `total` or `count`, and will print 'Skipping non-positive number:' for each element in `numbers`.
If `numbers` contains positive integers, the loop will iterate through each element, updating `total` with the sum of positive integers, incrementing `count` for each positive integer, and printing 'Skipping non-positive number:' for each non-positive integer. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will be the sum of positive integers, `count` will be the count of positive integers processed, and `num` will be the last popped integer.**
