Example Answer:
The code prints the message 'Skipping non-positive number:', followed by the value of `num`. The values of `numbers`, `total`, and `count` remain unchanged, so the output state is: numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the popped integer value.
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the popped integer value**
