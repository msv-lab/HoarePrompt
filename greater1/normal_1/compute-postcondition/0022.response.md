Output State: **If `numbers` is initially empty, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is undefined. If `numbers` contains only non-positive integers, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is undefined. If `numbers` contains positive integers, `total` is the sum of positive integers, `count` is the count of positive integers processed, `num` is the last popped integer, and `average` is calculated as `total / count`.**
