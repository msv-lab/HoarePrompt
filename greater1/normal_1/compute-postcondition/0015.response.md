Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`. The value of `num` is unknown, but it has been removed from the list `numbers`. If `num` was greater than 1, `total` would have been increased. The `count` might also have been incremented if `num` was positive. If `num` was not positive, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' would have been printed. 
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element removed, `num` is the popped integer, `total` may have been increased if `num` was greater than 1, `count` may have been incremented, or 'Skipping non-positive number: num' message has been printed**
