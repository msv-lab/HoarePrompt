According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element. To ensure the loop can execute again, the list `numbers` should still have at least one element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **numbers is a list of integers with at least one element**
