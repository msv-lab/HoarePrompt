Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is initially empty, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is undefined. If `numbers` contains only non-positive integers, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, `num` is undefined, and 'Skipping non-positive number:' is printed for each element in `numbers`. If `numbers` contains positive integers, after processing the loop, `numbers` is empty, `total` is the sum of positive integers, `count` is the count of positive integers processed, `num` is the last popped integer, and `average` is calculated as `total / count`.***
