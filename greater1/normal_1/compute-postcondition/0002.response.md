Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the last element of the list `numbers` using the `pop()` method. The list `numbers` will have one less element after popping, and `total` and `count` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **numbers is a list of integers with one less element, total is 0, count is 0, num is the popped integer value**
