Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code iterates through the list, calculating the sum of all elements greater than 1 and the count of such elements, which aligns with the problem description.
- If the list is not empty, it then computes the average of these elements, as required.
- If any non-positive numbers are encountered during iteration, a message is printed, but they do not affect the calculation, which is consistent with the problem description.
- If the list is empty or contains no elements greater than 1, the function correctly returns None, meeting the specified condition.
- Overall, the code follows the problem description for all potential cases, and the output hints further confirm the correctness of the code.
