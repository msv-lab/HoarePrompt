Output State: **If `numbers` list is not empty, the loop will continue to execute. After each iteration, `num` will be the last element removed from `numbers`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that have been removed, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and `numbers` will have the last element removed. If `num` is 1 or less, `total` and `count` will remain the same, and `numbers` will have the last element removed. If `num` is 1 or less, a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed. If `numbers` list is initially empty, the loop will not execute and `total` and `count` will remain 0.**
