Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`, and `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list is updated after popping the value. Therefore, after execution, the `total` is increased by the value of `num`, and the `numbers` list is updated.
Output State: **`num` is added to `total`, `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value**
