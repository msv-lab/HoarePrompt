Example Answer: 
The code prints a message indicating that a non-positive number is being skipped. The value of `num` is popped from the `numbers` list, and the `numbers` list is updated after popping the value. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value.
Output State: **`num` is assigned the value popped from the `numbers` list, `numbers` list is updated after popping the value**
