Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of integers. It iterates through the list, calculating the sum of all elements greater than 1 and the count of such elements. If the list is not empty, it then computes the average of these elements. If any non-positive numbers are encountered during iteration, a message is printed, but they do not affect the calculation. If the list is empty or contains no elements greater than 1, the function returns None. The function returns the calculated average if the list has elements greater than 1 and is not empty. **
