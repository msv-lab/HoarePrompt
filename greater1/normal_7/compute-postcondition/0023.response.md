Postcondition: ***If the `numbers` list is not empty, the loop will execute as described. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` will be the sum of all numbers greater than 1 that have been removed, `count` will be the number of elements greater than 1, and `numbers` will have the last element removed. If `num` is 1 or less, `total` and `count` will remain the same, and `numbers` will have the last element removed. If `num` is 1 or less, a message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' will be printed. If the `numbers` list is initially empty, the loop will not execute and `total` and `count` will remain 0. After the if else block, `average` will be calculated as total divided by count.***
