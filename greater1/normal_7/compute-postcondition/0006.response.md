Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the previous total and `num`, `count` is 1, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, `total` remains 0, `count` remains 0, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list. In case `num` is less than or equal to 1, the message 'Skipping non-positive number: num' is printed.***
