Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `numbers` is removed and assigned to `num`. The value of `num` will be the last element of the original list `numbers`. The values of `total` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is the last element that was removed from the list**
