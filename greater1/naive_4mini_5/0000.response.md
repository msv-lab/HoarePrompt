Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to find the average of positive integers in a list, but it has a flaw in the way it determines which numbers are positive. The condition `if num > 1:` checks for numbers strictly greater than 1, which means that it will skip the number 1, a positive integer. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will skip the number 1, resulting in a total of 5 (from 2 and 3) and a count of 2. The average will then be calculated as `5 / 2`, which equals 2.5, while the correct average of all positive integers (1, 2, 3) should be `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.0`. 

This discrepancy demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all positive integers as required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
