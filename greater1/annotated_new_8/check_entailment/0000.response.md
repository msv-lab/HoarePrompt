Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the program should find the average of the positive integers in a list. However, the current implementation of the code only considers numbers greater than 1, not all positive integers as required. This means that the code is not correctly calculating the average of all positive integers in the list.

The annotations also mention that the code skips non-positive numbers (numbers less than or equal to 1), which is not in line with the problem description. This discrepancy between the problem description and the actual code logic leads to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all positive integers in the list as required by the problem description.
