Example Answer:
`total` is increased by the value of `num`, which holds the value of the last element removed from the list. The previous state of `total`, `count`, and `num` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is increased by the value of the last removed element, `count` is adjusted based on the value of the last removed element, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is increased by the value of the last removed element, `count` is adjusted based on the value of the last removed element, `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed**
