Output State: **If the list `numbers` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute. For each iteration, the last element of `numbers` is removed and stored in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` is incremented by the value of `num` and `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program outputs 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. This process continues until all elements in `numbers` have been processed. After the loop finishes, `numbers` will be empty, `total` will hold the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, `count` will hold the count of such numbers, and `num` will hold the last removed element's value. If `numbers` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and all variables will remain at their initial values.**
