Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total`. Since `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed from the list `numbers`, the total is increased by that value. Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the value of the last removed element, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed accordingly.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` and `count` adjusted based on the value of the last removed element, and `num` holds the value of the last element that was removed accordingly**
