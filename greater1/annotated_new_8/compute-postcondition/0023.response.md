Postcondition: ***If `numbers` is initially empty, `numbers` is empty, `total` is 0, `count` is 0, `num` is not defined, and `average` will not be calculated. If `numbers` is not empty, `numbers` is empty, `total` holds the sum of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list, `count` holds the count of such numbers, `num` holds the last removed element's value, and `average` holds the average of all numbers greater than 1 in the initial list.***
