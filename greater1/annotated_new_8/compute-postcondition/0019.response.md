According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the last removed element `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, `total` should be increased by the value of `num` and `count` should be incremented by 1. If `num` is less than or equal to 1, the program outputs 'Skipping non-positive number: num'. 

So, no specific adjustments need to be made to the `numbers` list itself, but `total` and `count` need to be adjusted based on the value of the last removed element `num`.
State: **`total` and `count` are adjusted based on the value of the last removed element from `numbers`.**
