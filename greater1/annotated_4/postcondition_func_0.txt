The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input. It iterates through each element in the list, removing the last element and storing it in `num`. If `num` is greater than 1, it increments the `total` by `num` and increases the `count` by 1. If `num` is 1 or less, it prints a message. After processing all elements, if there are positive integers greater than 1, it calculates the average of those numbers as `total / count` and returns it. If the list is empty or contains no positive integers greater than 1, it returns None.
