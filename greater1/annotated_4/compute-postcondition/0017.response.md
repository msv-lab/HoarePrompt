Example Answer:
The code prints 'Skipping non-positive number:', num, where num is the last element removed from the list 'numbers'. The list 'numbers' has the last element removed, so the output state is 'numbers' is a list of integers with the last element removed and not empty. The values of 'total' and 'count' are adjusted based on the value of the last element removed. 
Output State: **'numbers' is a list of integers with the last element removed and not empty, 'total' and 'count' are adjusted based on the value of the last element removed**
