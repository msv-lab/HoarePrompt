Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `num`, where `num` is the last element removed from the list `numbers`. The value of `total` is increased by `num`, and `count` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the removed integer, `count` is 0, `num` is the removed integer.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `total` is the sum of the removed integer, `count` is 0, `num` is the removed integer**
