Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the condition `if num > 1:`. According to the problem description, the program should find the average of the positive integers in a list. However, the program skips numbers that are equal to 1, which are also positive integers.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will skip the number 1 and return the average of 2 and 3, which is 2.5. However, the correct average of the positive integers in the list should be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.

To fix this issue, the condition should be changed to `if num > 0:` to include all positive integers in the calculation.
