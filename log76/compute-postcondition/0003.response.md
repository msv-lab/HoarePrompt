The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` is an integer and is less than or equal to 0, the new value of `x` will be either -1 or remain at 0 if it was originally 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, and `x` is either -1 or 0 after the decrement.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, and `x` is either -1 or 0**
