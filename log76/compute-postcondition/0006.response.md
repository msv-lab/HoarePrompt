The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `x` is greater than 0, the function returns `x` increased by 1. If `x` is originally 0, the function returns -1. If `x` is originally -1, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and modify its value based on its initial state: increasing it by 1 if it's greater than 0, returning -1 if it's 0, and returning 0 if it's -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns x increased by 1 if x is greater than 0; returns -1 if x is 0; and returns 0 if x is -1.**
