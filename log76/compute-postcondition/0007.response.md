Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `x + 1` if `x` is greater than 0. If `x` is 0, it returns -1, and if `x` is -1, it returns 0. For any other negative integer, it decreases `x` by 1. Therefore, the function effectively increments positive integers, sets 0 to -1, sets -1 to 0, and decrements any other negative integers by 1. **
