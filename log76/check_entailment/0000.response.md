Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description specifies that the function should calculate the cumulative product of all non-zero numbers in a list, and if a zero is encountered, it should add the product so far and start again. 

However, the annotated program `func_1(x)` simply modifies the integer `x` based on whether it is greater than zero or not. It does not handle a list, does not calculate a cumulative product, and does not manage zeros in any way. Instead, it only returns an adjusted value of `x`. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
