`counter` is decremented by 1. Since `counter` is initially 1 or greater, its new value will be 0 or greater, depending on its previous value. The value of `total` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is 1 or greater, `total` is now equal to 2 times the previous value of `counter`, and `counter` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`counter` is 1 or greater, `total` is now equal to 2 times the previous value of `counter`, and `counter` is decreased by 1.**
