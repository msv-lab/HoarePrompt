According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `counter`. If `counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `counter` is 1 or greater, which means it can execute at least one more time. However, since `counter` is decreased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `counter` must currently be greater than 1. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `counter` is now greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`counter` is greater than 1, `total` is now equal to 2 times the previous value of `counter`, and `counter` is decreased by 1**
