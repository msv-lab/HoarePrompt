`counter` is decremented by 1. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0, the new value of `counter` will be a positive integer. The value of `total` remains unchanged and is still equal to the previous value of `counter`. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is now equal to the previous value of `counter`, and `counter` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0; `total` is now equal to the previous value of `counter`; `counter` is decreased by 1**
