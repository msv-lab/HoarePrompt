`total` is updated by adding the value of `counter` to it. Since `counter` is 1 or greater, the new value of `total` will be the previous value of `counter` plus the current value of `counter`. The previous state of `total` is equal to the previous value of `counter`. Therefore, if we denote the previous value of `counter` as `c`, then the new value of `total` becomes `c + c`, which is `2c`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`counter` is 1 or greater, `total` is now equal to 2 times the previous value of `counter`**
