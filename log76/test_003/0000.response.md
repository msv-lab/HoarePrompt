The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `counter`. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` will now be equal to its previous value (0) plus the value of `counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is now equal to `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is now equal to `counter`**
