        "reason": "Both postconditions describe the same program state: the variable `total` holds the sum of the integers from 0 to `n-1`. The expected postcondition states this in a straightforward manner, while the computed postcondition provides a mathematical formula for the sum, `(n-1)n/2`, which is the correct formula for the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, both postconditions ensure that `n` is an integer, with the computed postcondition further specifying that `n` is non-negative, which is a reasonable assumption for summing integers starting from 0. Thus, semantically, both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program."

        "reason": "Both postconditions describe the same end state of the program, albeit in slightly different terms. The Expected Postcondition states that `total` is the sum of integers from the initial `counter` value down to 1, and that `counter` is 0. The Computed Postcondition describes `total` as the sum of integers from 1 up to the initial `counter` value, using the arithmetic series formula `(initial counter * (initial counter + 1)) / 2` to compute this sum. Both descriptions ultimately represent the same summation process and result in the same value for `total`. Additionally, both postconditions indicate that `counter` is 0 at the end. Therefore, they are semantically the same."
