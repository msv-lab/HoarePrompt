The Expected Postcondition states that `numbers` is a list of integers and `total` is the sum of all integers in that list. The Computed Postcondition similarly indicates that `total` is equal to the sum of all integers in `numbers` and that `numbers` is a list of integers. Despite slight differences in wording, they both convey the same semantic meaning regarding the contents of `numbers` and the value of `total`."
