The value of `total` is incremented by `num`. Since `num` is the second integer in the list `numbers`, the new value of `total` will be the original value of `total` plus the value of `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the original value plus `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list.

Output State: **`total` is the original value plus `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, `num` is the second integer in the list**
