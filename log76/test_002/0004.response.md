According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop will execute again for the third integer. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the original value plus `num`, and `num` is the second integer in the list. This indicates that `num` is now the second integer in `numbers`, which means `num` is at index 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 integers, and `num` will become the third integer in the list, which will be at index 2.

State: **`total` is the original value plus `num`, for the loop to execute a third time `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list**
