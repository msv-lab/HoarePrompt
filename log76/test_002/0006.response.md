According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If there are more integers in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total` has been updated to the original value plus `num`, and `num` is the third integer in the list. To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next integer in the list. 

Assuming `num` was the third integer, for the loop to execute again, we need to move to the fourth integer in the list. Therefore, after this iteration, the `total` remains as is (since it has already been updated), and `num` should be set to the fourth integer in the list. 

State: **`total` is the original value plus the third integer in the list, for the loop to execute a fourth time `numbers` must contain at least 4 integers, and `num` is the fourth integer in the list.**
