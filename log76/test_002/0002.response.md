According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop will execute again for the next integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` could have been a list with at least one integer, and `num` is the first integer in the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least two integers, and `num` would then be the second integer in the list.

State: **`total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list**
