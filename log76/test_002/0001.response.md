`total` is incremented by `num`, which is the first integer in the list `numbers`. Since `total` is initially 0, after executing the code, `total` will equal `num`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, and `num` is the first integer in the list.

Output State: **`total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, `num` is the first integer in the list**
