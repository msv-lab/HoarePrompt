SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same program state: the variable `total` holds the sum of the integers from 0 to `n-1`. The expected postcondition states this in a straightforward manner, while the computed postcondition provides a mathematical formula for the sum, `(n-1)n/2`, which is the correct formula for the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, both postconditions ensure that `n` is an integer, with the computed postcondition further specifying that `n` is non-negative, which is a reasonable assumption for summing integers starting from 0. Thus, semantically, both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program.
