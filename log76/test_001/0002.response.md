According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1, and `n` must remain greater than 0. Since `n` is already greater than 0, we do not need to change that condition. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i`.

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
