`total` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. Initially, `total` is 0 and `i` is 0, so after execution, `total` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.  
Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
