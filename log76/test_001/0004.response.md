According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 2.

State: **`total` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
