According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `total` remains 0, and `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0. 

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
