According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, which means `n` must also be at least 4 to satisfy the condition `i < n`. 

Currently, `n` is only stated as being greater than 1, but in order for the loop to execute again with `i` being 3, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 3.

State: **`total` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
