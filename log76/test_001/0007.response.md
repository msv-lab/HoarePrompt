To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can analyze the loop provided. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, which means it will execute `n` times if `n` is greater than `0`. The variable `total` accumulates the sum of the values from `0` to `n-1`.

If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains `0`.

If `n` is greater than `0`, the loop will execute `n` times, and the final value of `total` will be the sum of the integers from `0` to `n-1`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers: 
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]
In this case, \( k = n - 1 \):
\[ \text{total} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \]

Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1`, which is `(n-1)n/2`, `n` is a non-negative integer.**
