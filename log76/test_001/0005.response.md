The value of `total` is incremented by `i`. With `total` being 1 and `i` being 2, the new value of `total` becomes `1 + 2`, which is 3. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`total` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
