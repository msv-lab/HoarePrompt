The code `total += i` adds the value of `i` to `total`. The initial state indicates that `total` is 0 and `i` is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `total` will be updated to 0 + 1, which equals 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`total` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
