SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same end state of the program, albeit in slightly different terms. The Expected Postcondition states that `total` is the sum of integers from the initial `counter` value down to 1, and that `counter` is 0. The Computed Postcondition describes `total` as the sum of integers from 1 up to the initial `counter` value, using the arithmetic series formula `(initial counter * (initial counter + 1)) / 2` to compute this sum. Both descriptions ultimately represent the same summation process and result in the same value for `total`. Additionally, both postconditions indicate that `counter` is 0 at the end. Therefore, they are semantically the same.
