You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: implement a function computing the n-th Fibonacci's number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    high, medium, low = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num > 10:
            high += 1
        elif num > 0:
            medium += 1
        else:
            low += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `high` is the count of integers in `numbers` greater than 10, `medium` is the count of integers in `numbers` greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, `low` is the count of integers in `numbers` less than or equal to 0, and `numbers` is a list of integers.
    return high, medium, low
    #The program returns the counts of integers in the list 'numbers': 'high' is the count of integers greater than 10, 'medium' is the count of integers greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, and 'low' is the count of integers less than or equal to 0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
