Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem description. Instead, it counts how many integers in a given list are categorized as 'high', 'medium', or 'low' based on their values. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirement of calculating the n-th Fibonacci number, which is the main task specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
