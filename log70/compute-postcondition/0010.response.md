Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `num`, the first integer in `numbers`, is greater than 10, `high` is increased by 1, while `medium` and `low` remain at 0. If `num` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, `medium` is increased by 1 and remains 1, while `low` stays at 0. If `num` is less than or equal to 0, `low` is increased by 1 and becomes 1, while `medium` stays at 0. This captures all cases for the value of `num` relative to the integer thresholds.***
