According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will continue iterating as long as there are more integers in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num` is now set to the fourth integer in the list, and the `numbers` list must have at least 4 integers.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `numbers` must have at least 4 integers.
- `num` should be the fourth integer in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 4 integers, num is the fourth integer in the list**
