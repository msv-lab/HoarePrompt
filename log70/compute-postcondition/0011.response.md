According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, the loop can continue as long as there are more integers in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` will have taken the value of the first integer in `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next integer in the list of `numbers`.

- Since `numbers` is a list with at least 1 integer, we assume it has at least 2 integers after the last iteration. 
- The next value of `num` will be the second integer in `numbers`.

Thus, we need to state that `numbers` has at least 2 integers for the loop to continue and modify `num` accordingly.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list**
