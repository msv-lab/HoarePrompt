The value of `medium` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `medium` is unknown. The value of `num` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `medium` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `medium` is increased by 1**.
