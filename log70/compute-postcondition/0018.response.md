The value of `high` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `high` is unknown. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `high` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `high` is increased by 1**.
