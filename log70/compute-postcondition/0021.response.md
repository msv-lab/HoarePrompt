Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list. If `num` is greater than 0, `medium` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is less than or equal to 0, `low` is increased by 1. This encompasses all possible values of `num`, including cases where `num` is exactly 0.***
