The value of `high` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `high` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables, `numbers` and `num`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `high` without specifying its previous value.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `high` is increased by 1.**
