`medium` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `medium` is 0, so after execution, `medium` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `high` is 0, `medium` is 1, `low` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the `numbers` list, `num` is less than or equal to 10, and `num` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `high` is 0, `medium` is 1, `low` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the `numbers` list, `num` is less than or equal to 10, and `num` is greater than 0.**
