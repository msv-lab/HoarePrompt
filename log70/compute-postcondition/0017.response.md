According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are integers left in the list `numbers`. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more integer in the list after the second integer. Hence, `numbers` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` must be updated to the third integer in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list.**
