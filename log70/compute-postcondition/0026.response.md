The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it counts the integers in the list and categorizes them into three groups: 'high', which is the count of integers greater than 10; 'medium', which is the count of integers greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10; and 'low', which is the count of integers less than or equal to 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `numbers` and return the counts of integers categorized as 'high', 'medium', and 'low' based on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the counts of integers categorized as 'high' (greater than 10), 'medium' (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10), and 'low' (less than or equal to 0).**
