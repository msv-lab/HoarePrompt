Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `num` is greater than 0, then `medium` is increased by 1 and remains 1, while `low` stays at 0. If `num` is less than or equal to 0, then `low` is increased by 1 and becomes 1, while `medium` stays at 0. Additionally, `num` is less than or equal to 10.***
