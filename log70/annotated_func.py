#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    high, medium, low = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num > 10:
            high += 1
        elif num > 0:
            medium += 1
        else:
            low += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `high` is the count of integers in `numbers` greater than 10, `medium` is the count of integers in `numbers` greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, `low` is the count of integers in `numbers` less than or equal to 0, and `numbers` is a list of integers.
    return high, medium, low
    #The program returns the counts of integers in the list 'numbers': 'high' is the count of integers greater than 10, 'medium' is the count of integers greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, and 'low' is the count of integers less than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns three counts: 'high' for the number of integers greater than 10, 'medium' for the number of integers greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, and 'low' for the number of integers less than or equal to 0. The function correctly categorizes the integers based on these criteria without any missing logic or edge cases.
