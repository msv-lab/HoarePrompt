Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not compute the n-th Fibonacci number as required by the problem description. Instead, it performs a series of operations based on the input integer `x`, which includes incrementing it if it is greater than 0 or returning `x - 1` if it is less than or equal to 0. 

To clarify:
1. The program checks if `x` is greater than 0; if so, it increments `x` by 1.
2. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, it returns `x - 1`.
3. Finally, it returns `x` which is now guaranteed to be greater than 0 if the first condition was satisfied.

None of these operations relate to calculating the n-th Fibonacci number, which is defined by the Fibonacci sequence (F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1). The program does not implement any of the logic necessary to generate Fibonacci numbers, hence it does not satisfy the problem description.
