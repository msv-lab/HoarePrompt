To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's behavior with respect to the variable `num`, specifically focusing on its divisibility by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. 

Given the conditions provided, if the loop completes all its iterations without returning `False`, it indicates that `num` is not divisible by any integer in the range checked (2 to √num). The implications of this are:

1. `num` must be an odd integer greater than or equal to 4.
2. Since the loop checks divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `num`, it implies that `num` is a prime number or 1 (in the context that it has no divisors other than 1 and itself).

For the loop to terminate without returning `False`, `num` must not be divisible by any of the integers in that range, meaning it remains prime. 

Considering that the loop checks values of `i` starting from 2, if the loop executes completely, the last value of `i` would be the integer closest to the square root of `num`.

Thus, the final output state would reflect:

- `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `num` is confirmed to be an odd integer greater than or equal to 4 and is not divisible by any integer from 2 to √num.
- The last value checked for `i` would be the largest integer less than or equal to √num.

Therefore, the output state can be concluded as follows:

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 4 and prime, `i` is the largest integer such that 2 <= `i` <= √num.**
