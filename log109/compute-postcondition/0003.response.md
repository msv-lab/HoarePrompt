According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `num`. The loop iterates from `2` to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `num` must be at least `4` because the smallest integer value for `int(num ** 0.5)` that allows the loop to run is `2` (when `num` is `4`, `int(4 ** 0.5)` is `2`). 

Additionally, we need to note that `i` will start at `2` in the first iteration. Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
