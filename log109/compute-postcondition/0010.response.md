To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information:

1. The loop iterates over the range starting from 2 up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. The current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is 3.
3. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Now, let's consider the implications:

- Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 4.
- We also need to ensure that the loop can still execute, which means `4` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5) >= 4`. This implies that `num` must be at least \(4^2 = 16\).

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 16, and `i` is 4.**
