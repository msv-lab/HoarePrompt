According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the result of `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `num` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 4, the expression `int(num ** 0.5)` will return an integer value. For example, if `num` is 9, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 3, making `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` equal to 4. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Currently, `i` is 2, so it can execute again if `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 2. 

Since `num` is at least 4 and odd, the smallest case is when `num` is 5, which gives `int(num ** 0.5)` equals 2, resulting in `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` equal to 3. Thus, the loop can execute again when `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 4 and odd, `i` is 3**
