The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer. The function checks several conditions to determine if `num` is a prime number. 

- In Case_1, if `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` cannot be prime. 
- In Case_2, if another negative condition is met, the function also returns `False`.
- In Case_3, the function returns `False` based on another specific condition in its logic.
- In Case_4, the function again returns `False` for another condition.
- In Case_5, if `num` meets the criteria for being a prime number, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept an integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number, returning `True` if it is prime and `False` if it is not, based on various conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num and returns `True` if num is a prime number; otherwise, it returns `False` based on multiple conditions.**
