The function accepts an integer `num` and returns `True` if `num` is a prime number (greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself); otherwise, it returns `False`. If `num` is less than 2, it immediately returns `False`. The function does not handle cases for numbers equal to 2 or 3, which are prime, but will return `True` for them as per the prime-checking logic.
