Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` inclusive, where each number must contain at most `k` different digits. 

However, the program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `is_prime`. The `func_1` function counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` (which is hard-coded as 10 in the example call), and the `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime. This is completely unrelated to the task of summing numbers based on digit constraints as specified in the problem statement.

There are several key points where the program deviates from the problem description:
1. It does not take input values `l`, `r`, and `k` as parameters in any of its functions.
2. It does not implement the logic to sum numbers in the range `[l, r]` based on the digit constraint.
3. The implementation of prime number counting has no relevance to the required solution.

Since the program does not address the problem as described, it fails to meet the criteria set forth in the problem statement.
