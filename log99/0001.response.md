To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(matrix)`.

### Problem Description:
The function should calculate the sum of all elements along both diagonals of a square matrix, ensuring that no element is counted twice.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += matrix[i][i]              # Adds the primary diagonal
        total += matrix[i][n - i - 1]      # Adds the secondary diagonal
    return total
```

### Key Points:
1. The primary diagonal consists of the elements `matrix[i][i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The secondary diagonal consists of the elements `matrix[i][n - i - 1]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
3. If the matrix has an odd dimension (e.g., 3x3), the center element will be counted in both diagonals, leading to it being added twice.

### Example Case to Test:
Consider a 3x3 matrix:
```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
- The primary diagonal sum: 1 (from [0][0]) + 5 (from [1][1]) + 9 (from [2][2]) = 15
- The secondary diagonal sum: 3 (from [0][2]) + 5 (from [1][1]) + 7 (from [2][0]) = 15
- The total calculated by the program will be 15 + 15 = 30, but the correct sum (without double counting the center element 5) should be 15 + (3 + 7) = 25.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the matrix has an odd dimension correctly because it counts the center element twice. 

Correctness: **False**.
