Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem statement. Instead, it computes the sum of a list of integers. 

To elaborate:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers called `numbers` and calculates the total sum of those integers.
- The problem description specifically requires a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number, which is entirely different from summing integers.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
