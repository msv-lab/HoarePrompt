`total` is incremented by `num`, which is the first element of the list `numbers`. Since `total` starts at 0, the new value of `total` will be equal to `num`. The other variables `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `num` is the first element of `numbers`.

Output State: **`total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `num` is the first element of `numbers`**
