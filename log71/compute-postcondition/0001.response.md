The variable `total` is initialized to 0. The list `numbers` remains unchanged, and its length is still greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers, its length is greater than 0, and `total` is 0. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, its length is greater than 0, and `total` is 0**
