According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more elements in the `numbers` list to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element of `numbers`. Since `numbers` has a length greater than 0, it has at least one element.

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must be updated to the next element in the list. Assuming the previous `num` was the first element, for the loop to execute again, `num` needs to be the second element of `numbers`, and the total count of elements in `numbers` should be at least 2.

State: **`total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
