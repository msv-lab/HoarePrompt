The loop iterates over all elements in the list `numbers`, adding each element to `total`. Since `numbers` has a length greater than 0, the loop will execute for each integer in the list. After all iterations are complete, `total` will contain the sum of all integers in `numbers`. 

Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of all integers in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 0.**
