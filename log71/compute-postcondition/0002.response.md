According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `numbers` list is not empty. Since it is stated that `numbers` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the beginning of the loop, the variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the `numbers` list during its first iteration. Since `total` is 0 and does not influence the execution of the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `num` variable needs to be initialized to the first element of the `numbers` list.

State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `num` is the first element of `numbers`**
