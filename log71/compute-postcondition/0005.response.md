The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `num`. Since `num` is defined as the second element of the list `numbers`, `total` will be updated to `total + num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, and `total` is updated to `total + num`.

Output State: **`total` is updated to `total + num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
