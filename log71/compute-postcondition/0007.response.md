The variable `total` is updated by adding `num` to it. Given that `num` is defined as the third element of the `numbers` list, and since `numbers` has a length greater than 2, `num` has a specific integer value. The previous state of `total` is known, and it is updated by this specific integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated to `total + num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 2, `num` is the third element of `numbers`.

Output State: **`total` is updated to `total + num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with length greater than 2, `num` is the third element of `numbers`**
