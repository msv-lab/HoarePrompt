The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `n` after the execution of the if statement. Additionally, the program returns the last value of 'prev' after the loop finishes. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, and if `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, there is no change to the state of `n`, and the function returns the last value of 'prev' after the loop finishes.
