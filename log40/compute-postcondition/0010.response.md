According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 5**
