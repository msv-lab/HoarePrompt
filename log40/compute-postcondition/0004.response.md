According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prev` is 0, and `curr` is 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` should start at 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prev` is 0, `curr` is 1, `i` is 2**
