Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incorrect. The implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is incorrect as it does not follow the standard Fibonacci sequence logic. The assignment of `prev` and `curr` values inside the loop is incorrect, resulting in the wrong calculation of the Fibonacci numbers. 

An example where this code fails is when `n = 5`. The correct Fibonacci sequence for `n = 5` should be `5`. However, the code provided will not produce the correct result for this case.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of computing the n-th Fibonacci number for all potential cases and is incorrect.
