The value of `counter` is decremented by 1. Since `counter` is greater than 0, it will now be less than its previous value. The `total` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is now less than its previous value, `total` is greater than its previous value by the amount of the original `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is now less than its previous value, `total` is greater than its previous value by the amount of the original `counter`.**
