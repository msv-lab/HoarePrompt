The value of `counter` is decreased by 1. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0, its new value will still be greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement. The variable `total` is not affected by this operation, so it remains greater than its previous value by the amount of the original `counter`. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is now an integer greater than or equal to 0; `total` remains greater than its previous value by the amount of the original `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is now an integer greater than or equal to 0; `total` remains greater than its previous value by the amount of the original `counter`.**
