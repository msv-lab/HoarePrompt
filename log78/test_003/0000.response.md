The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `counter`. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0 and `total` is initially 0, the new value of `total` will be `total + counter`, which is greater than 0. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is now greater than 0.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer greater than 0, `total` is now greater than 0**
