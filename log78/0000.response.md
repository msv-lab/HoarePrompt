SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same final state of the program. They indicate that the variable `counter` is 0, and the variable `total` is the sum of integers from the initial value of `counter` down to 1. The expected postcondition states "from the initial value of 'counter' to 1," while the computed postcondition states "from 1 to the original value of `counter`." Despite the difference in wording, both describe the same summation process, starting from 1 to the initial value of `counter`, resulting in the same total sum. Therefore, the semantic meaning is the same.
