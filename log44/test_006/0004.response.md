Example Answer:
The value of `outer_counter` is decremented by 1. The states of `inner_counter` and `total` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: outer_counter is decremented by 1, inner_counter and total remain unchanged.
Output State: **outer_counter is decremented by 1, inner_counter and total remain unchanged**
