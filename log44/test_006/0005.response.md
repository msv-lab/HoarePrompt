According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable outer_counter. If outer_counter is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, outer_counter is decremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, outer_counter needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.
State: **outer_counter is decremented by 1, inner_counter and total remain unchanged, outer_counter is greater than 1**
