According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `inner_counter`. If `inner_counter` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0, and `total` is the initial value of total plus the updated value of `inner_counter`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `inner_counter` should be adjusted to be greater than 1.
State: **`outer_counter` and `inner_counter` are integers greater than 0, `total` is the initial value of total plus the updated value of `inner_counter`, `inner_counter` is greater than 1**
