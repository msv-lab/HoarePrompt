Example Answer:
The value of inner_counter is decremented by 1. The previous value of inner_counter is greater than 0, so after execution, inner_counter will be updated accordingly. The total variable is not affected, so the Output State is: outer_counter and inner_counter are integers greater than 0, total is the initial value of total plus the updated value of inner_counter.
Output State: **outer_counter and inner_counter are integers greater than 0, total is the initial value of total plus the updated value of inner_counter**
