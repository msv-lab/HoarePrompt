Example Answer: 
The value of inner_counter is added to the total. Since the initial state mentions that outer_counter and inner_counter are integers greater than 0, and total is 0, after execution, the value of total will be the initial value of total plus the value of inner_counter. Therefore, the Output State is: outer_counter and inner_counter are integers greater than 0, total is the initial value of total plus the value of inner_counter.
Output State: **outer_counter and inner_counter are integers greater than 0, total is the initial value of total plus the value of inner_counter**
