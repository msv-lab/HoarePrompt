SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected and computed postconditions describe similar but not identical states. The expected postcondition asserts that 'numbers' is a list of integers and 'total' is the sum of all integers in that list. The computed postcondition also asserts that 'total' is the sum of all integers in the list and 'numbers' is a list of integers, but it adds an additional condition: 'numbers' must contain at least one integer and specifies 'num' as the last integer in the list. This additional condition about the non-emptiness of the list and the specification of the last element introduces a requirement not present in the expected postcondition, making them semantically different.
