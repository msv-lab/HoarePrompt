SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition describes specific values for `prev` and `curr` based on the value of `n`. It states that if `n` is 0, `prev` and `curr` will both be 1, and for `n > 0`, `prev` is either 1 or 0 and `curr` is either 0 or 1. This suggests a limited range of values for `prev` and `curr`. However, the computed postcondition specifies that `prev` and `curr` are the Fibonacci numbers at positions `n-1` and `n`, respectively, which allows for a broader range of values not restricted to 0 or 1 for `n > 0`. Therefore, the two postconditions describe different states for `prev` and `curr`, making them semantically different.
