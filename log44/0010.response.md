SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition states that if x > 0 and y < 0, z should be x - y, and if not, z can have any value. The computed postcondition, however, asserts that if x > 0 and y < 0, z is specifically assigned the value of x - y and remains a positive integer, with no further change outside this condition. The computed postcondition implies z retains its value if the conditions are not met, suggesting z cannot have any value in scenarios where x <= 0 or y >= 0, which contrasts with the expected postcondition that allows z to have any value in such cases. Thus, they do not semantically align regarding the behavior of z when the conditions are unmet.
