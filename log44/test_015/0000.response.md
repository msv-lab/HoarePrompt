Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr` which is 1, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr` which is 0 * 1 = 0. Therefore, after execution, `prev` is 1 and `curr` is 0. The value of `i` remains the same as 0 and `n` is still a non-negative integer.
Output State: **prev is 1, curr is 0, i is 0, n is a non-negative integer**
