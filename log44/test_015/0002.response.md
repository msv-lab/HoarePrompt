According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer**
