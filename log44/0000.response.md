SAME: True  
REASON: Both the expected and computed postconditions describe a state where `total` represents the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, they both imply that `n` is a non-negative integer (`n` is greater than or equal to 0), which aligns with the description of `total` being the sum from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, semantically, they describe the same program state, focusing on the non-negativity of `n` and the calculation of `total`.
