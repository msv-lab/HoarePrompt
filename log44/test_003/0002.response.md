According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the counter is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the counter is an integer greater than 0 and the total is the sum of the previous total and the new value of the counter. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the counter must be adjusted to be greater than 1.
State: **counter is an integer greater than 1, total is the sum of the previous total and the new value of counter**
