Example Answer:
The value of `counter` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `counter` is an integer greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, `counter` will still be greater than 0. The total will be updated as the sum of the previous total and the new value of `counter`. Therefore, the Output State is: counter is an integer greater than 0, total is the sum of the previous total and the new value of counter.
Output State: **counter is an integer greater than 0, total is the sum of the previous total and the new value of counter**
