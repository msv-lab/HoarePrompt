Example Answer:
The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `counter`. Since `counter` is an integer greater than 0, the value of `total` will increase by the value of `counter`. Therefore, the Output State is: counter is an integer greater than 0, total is the sum of the previous total and counter.
Output State: **counter is an integer greater than 0, total is the sum of the previous total and counter**
