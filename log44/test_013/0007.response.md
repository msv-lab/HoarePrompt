Example Answer:
y is assigned the value 100 times x. Since x is an integer and x is less than or equal to 10 and greater than 0, y will be a multiple of 100 within the range of 100 to 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: x is an integer and x is less than or equal to 10 and greater than 0; y is a multiple of 100 within the range of 100 to 1000.
Output State: **x is an integer and x is less than or equal to 10 and greater than 0; y is a multiple of 100 within the range of 100 to 1000**
