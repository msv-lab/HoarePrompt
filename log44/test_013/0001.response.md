Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by 10. Since the initial state mentions that `x` is an integer and its value is greater than 10, after execution, `y` will be equal to 10 times the value of `x`. The state of other variables remains unaffected.
Output State: **`x` is an integer and the value of x is greater than 10; `y` is 10 times the value of x**
