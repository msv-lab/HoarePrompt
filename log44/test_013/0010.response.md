Postcondition: ***x is an integer. If x is greater than 10, y is set to 10 times the value of x. If x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10, y is set to a value greater than 100. If x is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 5, y is a multiple of 100 within the range of 100 to 500. If x is less than or equal to 0, there is no change in the values of x and y.***
