Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer and x is less than or equal to 10. If x is greater than 5, `y` is set to a value greater than 100. If x is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 5, `y` is a multiple of 100 within the range of 100 to 500. If x is less than or equal to 0, there is no change in the values of x and y.***
