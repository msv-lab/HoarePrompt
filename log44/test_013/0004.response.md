Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of 20 times `x`, which is greater than 5. Therefore, after execution, `y` is a value greater than 100. The state of the variable `x` remains the same. 
Output State: **`x` is an integer and x is less than or equal to 10. x is greater than 5; `y` is a value greater than 100**
