SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program: the variable `counter` is 0, and the variable `total` holds the sum of a sequence of integers. Despite the different phrasing, both postconditions refer to the sum of integers starting from 1 up to the initial value of `counter`. This sequence, whether described as "from the initial value of 'counter' to 1" or "from 1 to the initial value of counter," results in the same summation. Therefore, semantically, both postconditions align.
