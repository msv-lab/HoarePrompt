SAME: True  
REASON: The expected and computed postconditions both describe the same logical behavior for the variable `x` based on the conditions involving the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Both postconditions state that:

- If `a > b` and `b > c`, then `x` is assigned the value `a - c` and is a positive integer.
- If `a > b` and `c > a`, then `x` is assigned the value `c - b` and is a positive integer.
- If `a > b` and `c <= a`, then `x` is assigned the value `a + b`.
- If `a <= b`, then `x` is assigned the value `b + c`.

The computed postcondition correctly captures the conditions and the resulting values for `x` as described in the expected postcondition, even though it uses slightly different phrasing. The semantic meaning is preserved across both descriptions, indicating they are the same.
