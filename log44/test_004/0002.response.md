The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements remaining in the 'numbers' list. In each iteration, the last element of the 'numbers' list is popped and added to the 'total'. This process will repeat until the 'numbers' list becomes empty. 

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
Output State: **'numbers' is an empty list, 'total' is the sum of all elements in the original 'numbers' list**
