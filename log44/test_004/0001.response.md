According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the `numbers` list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, and `total` is updated with the value of the popped element. For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list needs to have at least one element remaining after the last iteration.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element, `total` is updated with the value of the popped element**
