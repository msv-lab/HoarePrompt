Example Answer:
The code snippet pops the last element from the list `numbers` and adds it to the `total`. The previous values of the variables are `numbers` is a list of integers and `total` is 0. After the execution, the last element of the list will be removed and added to the `total`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the value of the popped element.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with one less element, `total` is updated with the value of the popped element**
