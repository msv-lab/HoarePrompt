According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 0. Before the loop starts, total is 0, so it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
