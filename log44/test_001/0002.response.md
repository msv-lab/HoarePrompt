According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0. Since `n` being greater than or equal to 0 allows the loop to execute again, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 1**
