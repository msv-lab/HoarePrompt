Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `curr` which is 1, and `curr` is assigned the value of `prev * curr` which is 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, after execution, `prev` becomes 1 and `curr` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected. 
Output State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
