According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can certainly execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prev` is 1, `curr` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer**
