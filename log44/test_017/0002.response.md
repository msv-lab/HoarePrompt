A `ZeroDivisionError` could occur at the division operation `result = numerator / denominator` if the `denominator` is 0. In that case, the `except` block sets the `result` variable to `None`. 
Therefore, the output state is: 
Output State: **numerator is a numeric value, denominator is a numeric value. If the denominator is 0, the result is set to None. Otherwise, the result is the division of numerator by denominator.**
