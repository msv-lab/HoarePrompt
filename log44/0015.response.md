SAME: False  
REASON: The expected postcondition describes a scenario where `prev` and `curr` are both equal to 1 regardless of the value of `n` (with a distinction for `n=0` and `n>0`), implying a specific state not related to the computation of factorials. The computed postcondition, however, describes `prev` as the factorial of `n` and `curr` as the factorial of `n+1`, which is a completely different logical state. Additionally, the computed postcondition specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, which is not mentioned in the expected postcondition. These differences indicate that the two postconditions describe different program states and behaviors.
