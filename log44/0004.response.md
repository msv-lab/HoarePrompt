SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions semantically describe the same main aspect, which is that `total` is the sum of all integers in the 2D list `matrix`. The computed postcondition provides additional information about `row` and `num`, which are not mentioned in the expected postcondition. However, this additional information does not contradict the core semantic meaning regarding the `total` variable, which is the main focus of the expected postcondition. Therefore, in terms of the main point about the sum of the matrix, the postconditions are semantically the same.
