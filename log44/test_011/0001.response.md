Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the value of `x - y`, where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is less than 0. The result of `x - y` will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`, but `z` will be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x is greater than 0, y is less than 0, z is a positive integer.
Output State: **x is greater than 0, y is less than 0, z is a positive integer**
