SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program. They specify that both `numerator` and `denominator` are numeric values and that the `result` is determined based on whether the `denominator` is zero or not. In both cases, if the `denominator` is zero, the `result` is `None`. Otherwise, the `result` is the division of the `numerator` by the `denominator`. Despite differences in wording, the semantic meaning of both postconditions is identical.
