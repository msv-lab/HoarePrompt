SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state after the execution of the function. The expected postcondition states that 'total' is the sum of all integers in 'numbers' and that 'numbers' is an empty list. The computed postcondition similarly states that 'numbers' is an empty list and 'total' is the sum of all elements from the original 'numbers' list. Although the wording is different, both postconditions convey that the list 'numbers' has been emptied and that 'total' holds the sum of the originally contained elements.
