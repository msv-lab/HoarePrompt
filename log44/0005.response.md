SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition describes the total as the sum of integers from `inner_counter` to 1 for each value of `outer_counter`, while the computed postcondition describes the total as the sum of integers from 1 to the initial value of `inner_counter`, multiplied by the initial value of `outer_counter`. These are different calculations and result in different values for `total`. The expected postcondition suggests a nested summation based on decrementing `inner_counter`, whereas the computed postcondition suggests a multiplication by the initial `outer_counter` value, implying a different logical flow or interpretation of the loop structure. Therefore, the postconditions are not semantically the same.
