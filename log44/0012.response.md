SAME: **False**  
REASON: The expected postcondition and the computed postcondition differ in several key aspects regarding the value of y. In the expected postcondition, specific multipliers for y are given based on the value of x: 10 times for x > 10, 20 times for 5 < x <= 10, and 100 times for 0 < x <= 5. Conversely, the computed postcondition describes y in terms of conditions that don't precisely match these multipliers. For example, it states that y is greater than 100 when 5 < x <= 10, rather than specifying it as 20 times x. Additionally, it describes y as a multiple of 100 for 0 < x <= 5, within a specified range, which doesn't exactly align with the expected y being 100 times the value of x. Furthermore, the computed postcondition mentions no change for x <= 0, whereas the expected postcondition allows y to have any value in this case. These discrepancies indicate that the two postconditions are not semantically identical.
