SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the behavior of the variable y in relation to x. The Expected Postcondition states that when x is greater than 0, y should be x + 1, which aligns with the Computed Postcondition that also specifies y is set to x + 1 when x is greater than 0. For x less than or equal to 0, the Expected Postcondition allows y to have any value, which is consistent with the Computed Postcondition stating that y remains unchanged. In both scenarios, the logical effect on y is semantically the same: y is x + 1 for x > 0, and y is unaffected when x <= 0, allowing any possible value.
