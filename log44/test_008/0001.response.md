Example Answer: 
`y` is assigned the value of `x`, and since `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` will take on the same value as `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is the same value as `x`.
Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is the same value as `x`**
