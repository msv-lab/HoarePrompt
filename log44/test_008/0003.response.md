Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the negative value of `x`. Since `x` is less than or equal to 0, the negative value of `x` will be either 0 or a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x is an integer, y is either 0 or a positive integer.
Output State: **x is an integer, y is either 0 or a positive integer**
