SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the state of variables `x` and `y` after executing the code. They agree that `x` is an integer. They also align in describing the behavior of `y`: if `x` is greater than 0, `y` is assigned the value of `x`; if `x` is less than or equal to 0, `y` is assigned the negation of `x`. The computed postcondition provides an additional clarification that when `x` is less than or equal to 0, `y` becomes a positive integer or 0 due to negation, which is consistent with the expected behavior described. Therefore, they are semantically the same.
