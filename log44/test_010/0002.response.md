Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the value of `x + y`, where `x` and `y` are integers greater than 0. The sum of two positive integers is always greater than 0. Therefore, `z` will be greater than 0 as well. The states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `z` is greater than 0**
