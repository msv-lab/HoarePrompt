Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the value of `x - y`, where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is less than or equal to 0. Since `y` is negative or zero, subtracting it from `x` will result in a positive value. Therefore, the value of `z` will be a positive integer. The states of `x` and `y` remain the same.
Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `y` is less than or equal to 0, `z` is a positive integer**
