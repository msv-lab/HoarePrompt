Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers. If `x` is greater than 0, then based on the value of `y`, `z` is either the sum or the difference of `x` and `y`, resulting in a positive integer. If `y` is greater than 0, `z` is the sum of `x` and `y`. If `y` is less than or equal to 0, `z` is the difference between `x` and `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `z` is equal to `y`, both of which are integers.***
