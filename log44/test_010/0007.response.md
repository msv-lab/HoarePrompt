Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the value of `y`. Since `y` is an integer, `z` will also be an integer. The value of `x` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: x is less than or equal to 0, y is an integer, z is an integer.
Output State: **x is less than or equal to 0, y is an integer, z is an integer**
