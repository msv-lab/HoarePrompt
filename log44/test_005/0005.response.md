According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the matrix and the current row being processed. If there are more rows in the matrix, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the matrix is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, total is the sum of all elements in the row, row is the last row of the matrix, and num is the last element in the row. For the loop to execute one more time, the matrix must have at least 2 rows, and the current row must not be the last row.

State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 2 rows, `total` is the sum of all elements in the new `row`, `row` is not the last row of the matrix, `num` is the last element in the new `row`**
