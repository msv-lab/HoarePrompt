According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the matrix. If the matrix has at least 1 row, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, total is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row and the loop control variable `row` is set to the first row of the matrix.
State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `total` is 0, `row` is the first row of the matrix**
