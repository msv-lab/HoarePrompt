According to the code, the loop can execute if the row has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, the total is 0, and row is the first row of the matrix. For the loop to execute, the row must have at least 1 element, and num should be the first element in the row.
State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `total` is 0, `row` is the first row of the matrix with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the row**
