Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to the `total`. Since `num` is the first element in the `row`, after execution, `total` will be incremented by the value of the first element in the `row`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `total` is updated with the sum of the first element in the `row`, `row` is the first row of the matrix with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the `row`.
Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `total` is updated with the sum of the first element in the `row`, `row` is the first row of the matrix with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the `row`**
