According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `row`. If there are more elements in the `row`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `total` is updated with the sum of the first element in the `row`, `row` is the first row of the matrix with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have more elements, and `num` must be the next element in the `row`.
State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of integers with at least 1 row, `total` is updated with the sum of the first element in the `row`, `row` is the first row of the matrix with at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in the `row`**
