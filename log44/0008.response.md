SAME: True  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical state of the program: they state that `x` is an integer, and based on the value of `x`, the string `y` is assigned a specific value. For `x > 0`, `y` is 'positive'; for `x == 0`, `y` is 'zero'; and for `x < 0`, `y` is 'negative'. The semantic meaning is preserved across both postconditions, as they both convey the same conditions and corresponding outcomes for `y` based on the value of `x`.
