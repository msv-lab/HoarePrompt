Example Answer:
x is assigned the value of a - c. Since a is greater than b and b is greater than c, the value of x will be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: a, b, and c are integers. The value of a is greater than the value of b. b is greater than c; x is a positive integer.
Output State: **a, b, and c are integers. The value of a is greater than the value of b. b is greater than c; x is a positive integer**
