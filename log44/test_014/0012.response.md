Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then based on the comparison between `b` and `c`, `x` is assigned a value. If `b` is greater than `c`, `x` is the difference between `a` and `c`, and `x` is a positive integer. If `c` is greater than `a`, `x` is the difference between `c` and `b`, and `x` is a positive integer. If none of the above conditions are met, `x` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then `x` is the result of adding `b` and `c`.***
