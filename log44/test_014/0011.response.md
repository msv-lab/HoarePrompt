Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `b + c`, where `b` is an integer and `c` is an integer. Since `a` is not involved in the calculation, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a, b, and c are integers. a is less than or equal to b; x is the result of adding b and c.
Output State: **`a, b, and c are integers. a is less than or equal to b; x is the result of adding b and c**.
