Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. The value of `a` is greater than the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than `c`, `x` is the difference between `a` and `c`, and `x` is a positive integer. If `c` is greater than `a`, `x` is the difference between `c` and `b`, and `x` is a positive integer. If none of the above conditions are met, `x` is the sum of `a` and `b`.***
