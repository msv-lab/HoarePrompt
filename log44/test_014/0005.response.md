Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `c - b`, where `c` is greater than `b`. Since the initial state mentions that `b` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` will be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: a, b, and c are integers. The value of a is greater than the value of b. The value of b is less than or equal to the value of c. The value of c is greater than the value of a; x is a positive integer.
Output State: **a, b, and c are integers. The value of a is greater than the value of b. The value of b is less than or equal to the value of c. The value of c is greater than the value of a; x is a positive integer**
