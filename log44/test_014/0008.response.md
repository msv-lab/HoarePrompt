Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. The value of `a` is greater than the value of `b`. The value of `b` is less than or equal to the value of `c`. If the condition `(c > a)` is true, `x` is the difference between `c` and `b`, and `x` is a positive integer. If the condition `(c > a)` is false, `x` is the sum of `a` and `b`.***
