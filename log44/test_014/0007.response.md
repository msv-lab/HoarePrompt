Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `a + b`. Since the value of `a` is greater than the value of `b`, `x` will be the sum of these two integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. The condition `(c > a)` is false, so the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. The value of `a` is greater than the value of `b`. The value of `b` is less than or equal to the value of `c`. The condition `(c > a)` is false. `x` is the sum of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. The value of `a` is greater than the value of `b`. The value of `b` is less than or equal to the value of `c`. The condition `(c > a)` is false. `x` is the sum of `a` and `b`**
