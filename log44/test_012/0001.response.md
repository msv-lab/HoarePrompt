Example Answer:
`y` is incremented by the value of `x`, where `x` is greater than 0. The previous values of `x` and `y` are known, so after execution, `y` will be the sum of its previous value and `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer representing the sum of its previous value and `x`, `z` is an integer.
Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer representing the sum of its previous value and `x`, `z` is an integer**
