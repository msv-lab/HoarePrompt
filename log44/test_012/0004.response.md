Example Answer:
`z` is updated by subtracting the value of `y`. Since `y` is a negative value, subtracting it from `z` will result in an increase in the absolute value of `z`. The values of `x` and `y` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: x, y, z are integers. If x > 0, y is updated to be the sum of its previous value and x. All other variables remain unchanged. y is a negative value, and z is updated by subtracting the absolute value of y.
Output State: **x, y, z are integers. If x > 0, y is updated to be the sum of its previous value and x. All other variables remain unchanged. y is a negative value, z is updated by subtracting the absolute value of y**
