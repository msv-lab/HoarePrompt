SAME: **True**  
REASON: Both postconditions describe the same logical behavior of the program for variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. They both specify that `x` and `y` are integers, and they outline how `z` is computed based on the values of `x` and `y`. In both descriptions, when `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `z` is the sum of `x` and `y`. When `x > 0` and `y <= 0`, `z` is the difference between `x` and `y`. Finally, when `x <= 0`, `z` is set to `y`. The computed postcondition includes additional information about `z` being a positive integer when `x > 0`, but this does not alter the fundamental logic regarding how `z` is calculated. Therefore, the semantic meaning of both postconditions aligns closely.
