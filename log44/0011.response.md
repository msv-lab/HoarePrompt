SAME: True  
REASON: The expected and computed postconditions both describe the same logical state of the program after execution. They both specify that x, y, and z are integers, and if x is greater than 0, y is increased by the value of x. Additionally, they both state that if y is negative after the first condition, z is decreased by the value of y. Although the computed postcondition phrases it as subtracting the absolute value of y, this effectively results in the same outcome since subtracting the absolute value of a negative y is equivalent to adding the negative y. Hence, semantically, both postconditions describe the same resulting state of the program.
