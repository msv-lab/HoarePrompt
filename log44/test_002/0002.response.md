According to the code, the loop can execute again if the `numbers` list has at least 2 integers. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 integers, and `num` should be the second integer in the list.
State: **`total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list**
