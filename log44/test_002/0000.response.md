According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the numbers list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 integer, and num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, numbers is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list**
