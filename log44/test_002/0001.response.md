Example Answer:
`total` is increased by the value of `num`, which is the first integer in the list `numbers`. The value of `total` is increased by the value of `num`, so `total` will be the initial value of `total` plus the value of `num`. The state of the list `numbers` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list.
Output State: **`total` is the initial value of `total` plus the value of `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list**
