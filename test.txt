You have been assigned the role of crossover assistant during genetic programming. You are assisting in the crossover between multiple parents. The goal is to create a child program that is a combination of the multiple parents. The parents are represented as a series of edits. The source file (code program or parameter file)  you are working on is presented below to give you context.
The fitness is runtime, the lower the better. You are trying to lower the speed . So the modifications you select must help lower the fitnesss (RUNTIME). THATS THE ONLY CRITERIA YOU ARE OPTIMISING BASED ON, we dont care about other criteria.
Your task is to select from the available parents the edits you think are the more beneficial to create a child program. The child program must be a combination of one edit from the available parents. Your response must adhere to the text format: Child: ***the child***.

The source file
CLI_PREFIX = " "
CLI_GLUE = "="
CLI_BOOLEAN = "hide"

# core
level [1, 9][6]
wbits [25, 31][28]
memLevel [1, 9][5]
strategy [0,4][3]



and these are the available parents each with his fitness. The lowest fitness the better the parent.
Available parents:
 Parent 1:
 with fitness 5.7202
Parent 1 has 2 edits: ["ParamSetting(('zlib.params', 'param', 'wbits'), 30)", "ParamSetting(('zlib.params', 'param', 'level'), 2)"]
 Parent 2:
 with fitness 5.6202
Parent 2 has 2 edits: ["ParamSetting(('zlib.params', 'param', 'strategy'), 2)", "ParamSetting(('zlib.params', 'param', 'memLevel'), 8)"]



We are also giving you some useful context about the program you are working on such as documentation:
### Parameters and Their Descriptions:

1. **level** (Default: `6`)

   - **Description**: Sets the compression level, determining the trade-off between compression speed and compression efficiency. The lower the level the fastest the program.
   - **Range**: Integer values from **1** to **9**.
   - **Details**:
     - `1`: Fastest compression speed, lowest compression ratio.
     - `9`: Slowest compression speed, highest compression ratio.
     - `6`: A balanced default level offering good compression speed and ratio.

2. **wbits** (Default: `28`)

   - **Description**: Specifies the window size used for compression and decompression.
   - **Range**: Integer values from **25** to **31**.
   - **Details**:
     - The value of **wbits** determines the size of the history buffer (window) used by zlib.
     - Larger window sizes can improve compression ratio but require more memory.
     - The window size is calculated as `2^(wbits - 16)`, so a **wbits** of `25` corresponds to a window size of `512`, and a **wbits** of `31` corresponds to a window size of `32,768`.

3. **memLevel** (Default: `5`)

   - **Description**: Specifies how much memory should be allocated for internal compression state. The higher the memLevel the faster the program.
   - **Range**: Integer values from **1** to **9**.
   - **Details**:
     - `1`: Minimum memory usage, potentially slower compression.
     - `9`: Maximum memory usage, potentially faster compression.
     - `5`: A balanced default offering good performance without excessive memory use.

4. **strategy** (Default: `3`)

   - **Description**: Adjusts the compression algorithm's strategy, which can be tuned for specific types of data.
   - **Range**: Integer values from **0** to **4**.
   - **Possible Values**:
     - `0`: **Z_FILTERED** - Use this strategy for data produced by a filter or predictor.
     - `1`: **Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY** - Use this strategy to force Huffman encoding only (no string matching).
     - `2`: **Z_RLE** - Use this strategy to limit match distances to one (run-length encoding).
     - `3`: **Z_FIXED** - Use this strategy to prevent the use of dynamic Huffman codes.
     - `4`: **Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY** - Use this strategy for normal data (default).



Remember you are assisting in the crossover between the parents. Choose one edit from each parent. Use the avaliuable documentation and any other context to explain what modification  you think will lead to the best child. Remember your goal is to make the child faster and improve runtime. thats the only goal.The proposed edits must be a combination of the available edits. Respond back with the child in the form of a list of edits in the same format as the parents are. Also give a small explanation.
Your response must adhere to the text format: Child: ***the child***.
