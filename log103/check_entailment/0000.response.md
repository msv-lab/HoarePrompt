Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not adhere to the problem description. The problem requires a function to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. However, the code only defines two functions: `func_1` and `is_prime`. 

1. The `func_1` function counts prime numbers less than `n`, which is irrelevant to the problem statement that requires summing numbers within a range based on their digit diversity.
2. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime, which again does not relate to the task of summing numbers with specific digit constraints.

There is no implementation to handle the range from `l` to `r`, nor any logic to filter numbers based on the number of different digits they contain. 

Thus, the code is incorrect as it does not perform the required task of summing numbers based on the conditions specified in the problem description. For instance, if we take `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 2`, the code would not be able to provide the correct sum of valid numbers (which should be `1230`), because the necessary logic for filtering and summing based on digit diversity is completely absent.
