According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `num` is greater than or equal to 4, we can calculate `int(num ** 0.5)`. Since `num` is odd (not divisible by 2), the smallest odd number that is greater than or equal to 4 is 5, which gives us `int(num ** 0.5)` as 2 for `num` values equal to 4. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` would be 3, but we also need to ensure that `num` is large enough such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `num` to be at least 9 (since the square root of 9 is 3), and `i` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, and `num` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`).**
