The loop checks for divisibility of `num` by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, it implies that `num` is prime. 

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can deduce the following:

1. The loop executes at least once if `num` is 4 or greater.
2. The loop will continue executing for each integer `i` from 2 up to and including `int(num ** 0.5)`. 
3. If `num` is not divisible by any of the integers checked in the loop, the function will continue executing without returning False.

Therefore, if the loop completes all iterations, it indicates that `num` is not divisible by any integer from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5)`, suggesting that `num` is prime.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is a prime number greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` indicating that the loop has completed all iterations without finding a divisor.**
