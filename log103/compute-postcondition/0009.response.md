Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 9 and not divisible by 2, and `i` is 3. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the program returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
