According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. We need to ensure that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

Since `num` is greater than or equal to 9, we can calculate `int(num ** 0.5)`. The smallest value for `num` is 9, which gives `int(9 ** 0.5)` as 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4, which means `num` must be at least 16 (since 4^2 = 16).

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 16 and not divisible by 2, and `i` is 4**
