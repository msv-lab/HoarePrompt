According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop will execute if `num` is at least 2, because it requires the starting point of 2. Given that `num` is stated to be greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute provided that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 2 (which will be the case as long as `num` is at least 4). 

To ensure the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 2. Therefore, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. `num` should be at least 2 (which it is).
2. The value of `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` should be at least 2, which implies that `num` must be at least 4 for the loop to have any iterations.

Thus, if `num` is at least 4, the loop will execute starting with `i` equal to 2. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
