The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than 1, it returns n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it recursively calculates the sum of func_1(0) and func_1(n-2). The annotations suggest that the function handles the recursive sum calculation correctly, but there might be an issue with the base case logic since the code does not explicitly handle the case when n is 0, potentially leading to unexpected behavior for n = 0.
