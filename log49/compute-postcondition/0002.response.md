Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n - 1)`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and less than or equal to 1, `n - 1` will be 0. The value of `x` is 1. Therefore, `func_1(0)` will return a specific value based on the implementation of `func_1`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, n is less than or equal to 1, x is 1, temp is the value returned by func_1(0)**
