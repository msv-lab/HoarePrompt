The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer.

Case 1: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the non-negative integer `n`.

Case 2: If `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1, the function returns the value obtained by adding the value returned by `func_1(0)` and the value returned by `func_1(n-2)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either `n` if it is greater than 1, or the sum of the value returned by `func_1(0)` and the value returned by `func_1(n-2)` if `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, returns n if n is greater than 1. If n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1, it returns the sum of func_1(0) and func_1(n-2).**
