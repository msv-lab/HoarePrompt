Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the n-th Fibonacci number as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is missing the base cases for Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1), and the logic within the function is flawed. The recursive calls are not properly calculating the Fibonacci numbers.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
For n = 2, the expected Fibonacci number is 1 (F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1). However, the program will return 2 due to the incorrect logic in the function.
