#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        x = 1
        temp = func_1(n - 1)
        print('n is greater than 1')
    else :
        x = 0
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer 'n' that is greater than 1
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: n is a non-negative integer, n is less than or equal to 1, x is 1, temp is the value returned by func_1(0)
    return temp + func_1(n - 2)
    #The program returns the value obtained by adding the value returned by func_1(0) and the value returned by func_1(n-2), where n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 1
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than 1, it returns n. If n is less than or equal to 1, it recursively calculates the sum of func_1(0) and func_1(n-2). The annotations suggest that the function handles the recursive sum calculation correctly, but there might be an issue with the base case logic since the code does not explicitly handle the case when n is 0, potentially leading to unexpected behavior for n = 0.
